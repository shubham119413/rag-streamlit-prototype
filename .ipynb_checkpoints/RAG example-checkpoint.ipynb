Moe,\\nOded Netzer, and David A. Schweidel\\nAbstract\\nWords are part of almost every marketplace interaction. Online reviews, customer service calls, press releases, marketing com-\\nmunications, and other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can marketers best use such data? This article provides an\\noverview of automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate marketing insights. The authors discuss how text\\nreflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient.\\nNext, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview\\nmethodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some\\ncommon metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a\\ndiscussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing.\\nWhile most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the\\nsubareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.\\nKeywords\\ncomputational linguistics, machine learning, marketing insight, interdisciplinary, natural language processing, text analysis, text mining\\nOnline supplement: https://doi.org/10.1177/0022242919873106\\nThe digitization of information has made a wealth of textual\\ndata readily available. Consumers write online reviews, answer\\nopen-ended survey questions, and call customer service repre-\\nsentatives (the content of which can be transcribed). Firms\\nwrite ads, email frequently, publish annual reports, and issue\\npress releases. Newspapers c ontain articles, movies have\\nscripts, and songs have lyrics. By some estimates, 80%–95%\\nof all business data is unstructured, and most of that unstruc-\\ntured data is text (Gandomi and Haider 2015).\\nSuch data has the potential to shed light on consumer, firm,\\nand market behavior, as well as society more generally. But, by\\nitself, all this data is just that—data. For data to be useful,\\nresearchers must be able to extract underlying insight—to mea-\\nsure, track, understand, and interpret the causes and conse-\\nquences of marketplace behavior.\\nThis is where the value of automated textual analysis comes\\nin. Automated textual analysis 1 is a computer-assisted\\nmethodology that allows researchers to rid themselves of mea-\\nsurement straitjackets, such as scales and scripted questions,\\nand to quantify the information contained in textual data as it\\nnaturally occurs. Given these benefits, the question is no longer\\nwhether to use automated text analysis buthow these tools can\\nbest be used to answer a range of interesting questions.\\nThis article provides an overview of the use of automated\\ntext analysis for marketing insight. Methodologically, text\\nanalysis approaches can describe “what” is being said and\\n“how” it is said, using both qualitative and quantitative inqui-\\nries with various degrees of human involvement.

First, we illustrate how text data can be used for\\nboth prediction and understanding, to gain insight into who\\nproduced that text, as well as how that text may impact the\\npeople and organizations that consume it. Second, we provide a\\nhow-to guide for those new to text analysis, detailing the main\\ntools, pitfalls, and challenges that researchers may encounter.\\nThird, we offer a set of expansive research propositions per-\\ntaining to using text as a means to understand meaning making\\nin markets with a focus on how customers, firms, and societies\\nconstrue or comprehend marketplace interactions, relation-\\nships, and themselves. Whereas previous treatments of text\\nanalysis have looked specifically at consumer text (Humphreys\\nand Wang 2017), social media communication (Kern et al.\\n2016), or psychological processes (Tausczik and Pennebaker\\n2010), we aim to provide a framework for incorporating text\\ninto marketing research at the individual, firm, market, and\\nsocietal levels. By necessity, our approach includes a wide-\\nranging set of textual data sources (e.g., user-generated content,\\nannual reports, cultural artifacts, government text).\\nFourth, and most importantly, we discuss how text analysis can\\nhelp “unite the tribes.” As a field, part of marketing’s value is its\\ninterdisciplinary nature. Unlike core disciplines such as psychol-\\nogy, sociology, or economics, the marketing discipline is a big\\ntent that allows researchers from different traditions and research\\nphilosophies (e.g., quantitative modeling, consumer behavior,\\nstrategy, consumer culture theory) to come together to study\\nrelated questions (Moorman et al. 2019a, b). In reality, however,\\nthe field often seems fragmented. Rather than different rowers all\\nsimultaneously pulling together, it often feels more like separate\\ntribes, each independently going off in separate directions.\\nAlthough everyone is theoretically working toward similar goals,\\nthere tends to be more communication within groups than\\nbetween them. Different gr oups often speak different\\n“languages” (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, statis-\\ntics, economics, organizational behavior) and use different tools,\\nmaking it increasingly difficult to have a common conversation.\\nHowever, text analysis can unite the tribes. Not only does it\\ninvolve skills and ideas from each of these areas, doing it well\\nrequires such integration because it borrows ideas, concepts,\\napproaches, and methods from each tribe and incorporates them\\nto achieve insight. In so doing, the approach also adds value to\\neach of the tribes in ways that might not otherwise be possible.\\nWe start by discussing two distinctions that are useful when\\nthinking about how text can be used: (1) whether text reflects or\\nimpacts (i.e., says something about the producer or has a down-\\nstream impact on something else) and (2) whether text is used\\nfor prediction or understanding (i.e., predicting something or\\nunderstanding what caused something). Next, we explain how\\ntext may be used to unite the tribes of marketing. Then we\\nprovide an overview of text analysis tools and methodology\\nand discuss key questions and measures of validity. Finally,\\nwe close with a future research agenda.\\nThe Universe of Text\\nCommunication is an integral part of marketing. Not only do\\nfirms communicate with customers, but customers communi-\\ncate with firms and one another. Moreover, firms communicate\\nwith investors and society communicates ideas and values to\\nthe public (through newspapers and movies). These communi-\\ncations generate text or can be transcribed into text.\\nA simple way to organize the world of textual data is to\\nthink about producers and receivers—the person or organi-\\nzation that creates the text and the person or organization\\nwho consumes the text (Table 1). While there are certainly\\nother parties that could be listed, some of the main\\nproducers and receivers are consumers, firms, investors, and\\nsociety at large. Consumers write online reviews that are\\nread by other consumers, firms create annual reports that\\nare read by investors, and cultural producers represent soci-\\netal meanings through the creation of books, movies, and\\nother digital or physical artifacts that are consumed by indi-\\nviduals or organizations.\\nConsistent with this distinction between text producer and\\ntext receiver, researchers may choose to study how text reflects\\nor impacts. Specifically, text reflects information about, and\\nthus can be used to gain insight into, the textproducer or one\\ncan study how text impacts the textreceiver.\\nText as a Reflection of the Producer\\nText reflects and indicates something about the text producer\\n(i.e., the person, organization, or context that created it). Cus-\\ntomers, firms, and organizations use language to express them-\\nselves or achieve desired goals, and as a result, text signals\\ninformation about the actors, organization, or society that cre-\\nated it and the contexts in which it was created. Like an anthro-\\npologist piecing together pottery shards to learn about a distant\\ncivilization, text provides a window into its producers.\\nTake, for example, a social media post in which someone\\ntalks about what they did that weekend. The text that person\\nproduces provides insight into several facets. First, it provides\\ninsight into the individual themselves. Are they introverted or\\nextraverted? Neurotic or conscientious? It sheds light on who\\nthey are in general (i.e., stable traits or customer segments;\\nMoon and Kamakura 2017) as well as how they may be feeling\\nor what they may be thinking at the moment (i.e., states). In a\\nsense, language can be viewed as a fingerprint or signature\\n(Pennebaker 2011). Just like brush strokes or painting style can\\nbe used to determine who painted a particular painting,\\nresearchers use words and linguistic style to infer whether a\\nplay was written by Shakespeare, or if a person is depressed\\n(Rude, Gortner, and Pennebaker 2004) or being deceitful\\n2 Journal of Marketing 84(1) (Ludwig et al. 2016). The same is true for groups, organiza-\\ntions, or institutions. Language reflects something about who\\nthey are and thus provides insight into what they might do in\\nthe future.\\nSecond, text can provide insight into a person’s attitudes\\ntoward or relationships with other attitude objects—whether\\nthat person liked a movie or hated a hotel stay, for example,\\nor whether they are friends or enemies with someone. Lan-\\nguage used in loan applications provides insight into whether\\npeople will default (Netzer, Lemaire, and Herzenstein 2019),\\nlanguage used in reviews can provide insight into whether they\\nare fake (Anderson and Simester 2014; Hancock et al. 2007;\\nTable 1.Text Producers and Receivers.\\nText\\nProducers\\nText Receivers\\nConsumers Firms Investors Institutions/Society\\nConsumers /C15 Online reviews (Anderson and\\nSimester 2014; Chen and Lurie 2013;\\nFazio and Rockledge 2015a; Kronrod\\nand Danziger 2013a; Lee and Bradlow\\n2011; Liu, Lee, and Srinivasan 2019a;\\nMelumad, Inman, and Pham 2019;\\nMoon and Kamakura 2017; Puranam,\\nNarayan, and Kadiyali 2017)\\n/C15 Social media (Hamilton, Schlosser, and\\nChen 2017a; Netzer et al. 2012;\\nVillarroel Ordenes et al. 2017)\\n/C15 Offline word of mouth (Berger and\\nSchwartz 2011a; Mehl and Pennebaker\\n2003a)\\n/C15 Forms and applications\\n(Netzer, Lemaire, and\\nHerzenstein 2019)\\n/C15 Idea-generation contexts\\n(Bayus 2013a; Toubia and\\nNetzer 2017)\\n/C15 Social media/brand\\ncommunities (Herhausen\\net al. 2019)\\n/C15 Consumer complaints\\n(Ma, Baohung, and Kekre\\n2015)\\n/C15 Customer language on\\nservice calls\\n/C15 Tweeting at companies\\n(Liu, Singh, and Srinivasan\\n2016a)\\n/C15 Stock market reactions to\\nconsumer text (Bollen,\\nMao, and Zeng 2011;\\nTirunillai and Tellis 2012)\\n/C15 Protests\\n/C15 Petitions\\n/C15 Crowdsourcing\\nknowledge\\n/C15 Letters to the editor\\n/C15 Online comments\\nsection\\n/C15 Activism (e.g.,\\norganizing political\\nmovements and\\nmarches)\\nFirms /C15 Owned media (e.g., company website\\nand social media; Villarroel Ordenes\\net al. 2018)\\n/C15 Advertisements (Fossen and\\nSchweidel 2017a, 2019; Liaukonyte,\\nTeixeira, and Wilbur 2015a; Rosa et al.\\n1999; Stewart and Furse 1986)\\n/C15 Customer service agents (Packard and\\nBerger 2019a; Packard, Moore, and\\nMcFerran 2018)\\n/C15 Packaging, including labels\\n/C15 Text used in instructions\\n/C15 Trade publications\\n(Weber, Heinze, and\\nDeSoucey 2008a)\\n/C15 Interfirm communication\\nemails (Ludwig et al.\\n2016)\\n/C15 White papers\\n/C15 Financial reports\\n(Loughran and McDonald\\n2016)\\n/C15 Corporate\\ncommunications (Hobson,\\nMayhew, and\\nVenkatachalam 2012)\\n/C15 Chief executive officer\\nletters to shareholders\\n(Yadav, Prabhu, and\\nChandy 2007\\n/C15 Editorials by firm\\nstakeholders\\n/C15 Interviews with\\nbusiness leaders\\nInvestors /C15 Letters to shareholders\\n(Yadav, Prabhu, and\\nChandy 2007)\\n/C15 Shareholder feedback\\n(Wies et al. 2019)\\n/C15 Sector reports\\nInstitutions/\\nsociety\\n/C15 News content (Berger, Kim, and\\nMeyer 2019; Berger and Milkman\\n2012; Humphreys 2010)\\n/C15 Movies (Berger, Moe, and Schweidel\\n2019; Eliashberg, Hui, and Zhang 2007,\\n2014; Toubia et al. 2019)\\n/C15 Songs (Berger and Packard 2018;\\nPackard and Berger 2019a)\\n/C15 Books (Akpinar and Berger 2015;\\nSorescu et al. 2018a)\\n/C15 Business section\\n/C15 Specialty magazines (e.g.,\\nWired, Harvard Business\\nReview)\\n/C15 Wall Street Journal\\n/C15 Fortune\\n/C15 Various forms of\\ninvestment advice that\\ncome from media\\n/C15 Government\\ndocuments, hearings,\\nand memoranda\\n(Chappell et al. 1997a)\\n/C15 Forms of public\\ndialogue or debate\\naReference appears in the Web Appendix.\\nBerger et al. 3 Ott, Cardie, and Hancock 2012), and language used by political\\ncandidates could be used to study how they might govern in the\\nfuture.\\nThese same approaches can also be used to understand\\nleaders, organizations, or cultural elites through the text they\\nproduce. For example, the words a leader uses reflect who\\nthey are as an individual, their leadership style, and their\\nattitudes toward various stakeholders. The language used in\\nads, on websites, or by customer service agents reflects infor-\\nmation about the company those pieces of text represent.\\nAspects such as brand personality (Opoku, Abratt, and Pitt\\n2006), how much a firm is thinking about its customers (Pack-\\nard and Berger 2019a), or managers’ orientation toward end\\nusers (Molner, Prabhu, and Yadav 2019) can be understood\\nthrough text. Annual reports provide insight into how well a\\nfirm is likely to perform in the future (Loughran and McDo-\\nnald 2016).\\nYet beyond single individuals or organizations, text can also\\nbe aggregated across creators to study larger social groups or\\ninstitutions. Given that texts reflect information about the peo-\\nple or organizations that created them, grouping people or\\norganizations together on the basis of shared characteristics\\ncan provide insight into the nature of such groups and differ-\\nences between them. Analyzing blog posts, for example, can\\nshed light on how older and younger people view happiness\\ndifferently (e.g., as excitement vs. peacefulness; Mogilner,\\nKamvar, and Aaker 2011). In a comparison of newspaper arti-\\ncles and press releases about different business sectors, text can\\nbe used to understand the creation and spread of globalization\\ndiscourse (Fiss and Hirsch 2005). Customers’ language use\\nfurther gives insight into the consumer sentiment in online\\nbrand communities (Homburg, Ehm, and Artz 2015).\\nMore broadly, because texts are shaped by the contexts (e.g.,\\ndevices, cultures, time periods) in which they were produced,\\nthey also reflect information about these contexts. In the case of\\nculture, U.S. culture values high-arousal positive affective\\nstates more than East Asian cultures (Tsai 2007), and these\\ndifferences may show up in the language these different groups\\nuse. Similarly, whereas members of individualist cultures tend\\nto use first-person pronouns (e.g., “I”), members of collectivist\\ncultures tend to use a greater proportion of third-person pro-\\nnouns (e.g., “we”).\\nAcross time, researchers were able to examine whether the\\nnational mood changed after the September 11 attacks by\\nstudying linguistic markers of psychological change in online\\ndiaries (Cohn, Mehl, and Pennebaker 2004). The language\\nused in news articles, songs, and public discourse reflects\\nsocietal attitudes and norms, and thus analyzing changes over\\ntime can provide insight into aspects such as attitudes toward\\nwomen and minorities (Boghrati and Berger 2019; Garg et al.\\n2018) or certain industries (Humphreys 2010). Journal articles\\nprovide a window into the evolution of topics within acade-\\nmia (Hill and Carley 1999). Books and movies serve as sim-\\nilar cultural barometers and could be used to shed light on\\neverything from cultural differences in customs to changes in\\nvalues over time.\\nConsequently, text analysis can provide insights that may\\nnot be easily (or cost-effectively) obtainable through other\\nmethods. Companies and organizations can use social listening\\n(e.g., online reviews and blog posts) to understand whether\\nconsumers like a new product, how customers feel about their\\nbrand, what attributes are relevant for decision making, or what\\nother brands fall in the same consideration set (Lee and Bra-\\ndlow 2011; Netzer et al. 2012). Regulatory agencies can deter-\\nmine adverse reactions to pharmaceutical drugs (Feldman et al.\\n2015; Netzer et al. 2012), public health officials can gauge how\\nbad the flu will be this year and where it will hit the hardest\\n(Alessa and Faezipour 2018), and investors can try to predict\\nthe performance of the stock market (Bollen, Mao, and Zeng\\n2011; Tirunillai and Tellis 2012).\\nText’s Impact on Receivers\\nIn addition to reflecting information about the people, organi-\\nzations, or society that created it, text also impacts or shapes the\\nattitudes, behavior, and choices of the audience that consumes\\nit. For example, take the language used by a customer service\\nagent. While that language certainly reflects something about\\nthat agent (e.g., their personality, how they are feeling that\\nday), how they feel toward the customer, and what type of\\nbrand they represent, that language also impacts the customer\\nwho receives it (Packard and Berger 2019a; Packard, Moore,\\nand McFerran 2018). It can change customer attitudes toward\\nthe brand, influence future purchase, or affect whether custom-\\ners talk about the interaction with their friends. In that sense,\\nlanguage has a meaningful and measurable impact on the\\nworld. It has consequences.\\nThis can be seen in a myriad of different contexts. Ad copy\\nshapes customers’ purchase behavior (Stewart and Furse\\n1986), newspaper language c hanges customers’ attitudes\\n(Humphreys and LaTour 2013), trade publications and con-\\nsumer magazines shift product category perceptions (e.g.,\\nRosa et al. 1999), movie scripts shape audience reactions\\n(Berger, Kim, and Meyer 2019; Eliashberg, Hui, and Zhang\\n2014; Reagan et al. 2016), and song lyrics shape song market\\nsuccess (Berger and Packard 2018; Packard and Berger\\n2019b). The language used inpolitical debates shapes which\\ntopics get attention (Berman et al. 2019), the language used in\\nconversation shapes interpersonal attitudes (Huang et al.\\n2017), and the language used in news articles shapes whether\\npeople read (Berger, Moe, and Schweidel, 2019b) or share\\n(Berger and Milkman 2012) them.\\nFirms’ language choice has impact as well. For example,\\nnuances in language choices by firms when responding to cus-\\ntomer criticism online directly impacts consumers and, thus,\\nthe firms’ success in containing social media firestorms (Her-\\nhausen et al. 2019). Language used in YouTube ads is corre-\\nlated with their virality (Tellis et al. 2019). Shareholder\\ncomplaints about nonfinancial concerns and topics that receive\\nhigh media attention substantially increase firms’ advertising\\ninvestments (Wies et al. 2019).\\n4 Journal of Marketing 84(1) Note that while the distinction between text reflecting and\\nimpacting is a useful one, it is not an either/or. Text almost\\nalways simultaneously reflects and impacts. Text always\\nreflects information about the actor or actors that created it,\\nand as long as some audience consumes that text, it also\\nimpacts that audience.\\nDespite this relationship, researchers studying reflection\\nversus impact tend to use text differently. Research that exam-\\nines what the text reflects often treats it as a dependent variable\\nand investigates how it relates to the text creator’s personality,\\nthe social groups they belong to, or the time period or culture in\\nwhich it was created.\\nResearch that examines how text impacts others often treats\\nit as an independent variable, examining if and how text shapes\\noutcomes such as purchase, sharing, or engagement. In this\\nframework, textual elements are linked with outcomes that are\\nbelieved to be theoretical consequences of the textual compo-\\nnents or some latent variable that they are thought to represent.\\nContextual Influences on Text\\nImportantly, text is also shaped by contextual factors; thus, to\\nbetter understand its meaning and impact, it is important to\\nunderstand the broader situation in which it was produced.\\nContext can affect content in three ways: through technical\\nconstraints and social norms of the genre, through shared\\nknowledge specific to the speaker and receiver, and through\\nprior history.\\nFirst, different types of texts are influenced by formal and\\ninformal rules and norms that shape the content and expecta-\\ntions about the message. For example, newspaper genres such\\nas opinion pieces or feature stories will contain a less\\n“objective” point of view than traditional reporting (Ljung\\n2000). Hotel comment cards and other feedback are usually\\ndominated by more extreme opinions. On Snapchat and other\\nsocial media platforms, messages are relatively recent, short,\\nand often ephemeral. In contrast, online reviews can be longer\\nand are often archived dating back several years. Synchronic\\ntext exchanges, in which two individuals interactively commu-\\nnicate in real time may be more informal and contain dialogue\\nof short statements and phatic responses (i.e., communication\\nsuch as “Hi,” which serves a social function) that indicate\\naffiliation rather than semantic content (Kulkarni 2014). Some\\ngenres (e.g., social media) are explicitly public, whereas on\\nothers, such as blogs, information that is more private may\\nbe conveyed.\\nText is also shaped by technological constraints (e.g., the\\nability to like or share) and physical constraints (e.g., charac-\\nter length limitations). Tweets, for example, necessarily have\\n280 characters or fewer, which may shape the ways in which\\nthey are used to communicate. Mobile phones have con-\\nstraints on typing and may shape the text that people produce\\non them (Melumad, Inman, and Pham 2019; Ransbotham,\\nLurie, and Liu 2019).\\nSecond, the relationship between the text producer and con-\\nsumer may affect what is said (or, more often, unsaid). If the\\nproducer and consumer know each other well, text may be\\nrelatively informal (Goffman 1959) and lack explicit informa-\\ntion that a third party would need to make sense of the con-\\nversation (e.g., past events, known likes/dislikes). If both have\\nan understanding of the goal of the communication (e.g., that\\nthe speaker wants to persuade the receiver), this may shape the\\ncontent but be less explicit.\\nThese factors are important tounderstand when interpret-\\ning the content of the text itself. Content has been shown to\\nbe shaped by the creator’s intended audience (Vosoughi,\\nRoy, and Aral 2018) and anticipated effects on the receiver\\n(Barasch and Berger 2014). Similarly, what consumers share\\nwith their best friend may be different (e.g., less impacted\\nby self-presentational motiv ations) than what they post\\nonline for everyone to see.2 Firms’ annual reports may be\\nshaped by the goals of appearing favorably to the market.\\nWhat people say on a customer service call may be driven\\nby the goal of getting monetary compensation. Consumer\\nprotests online are meant to inspire change, not merely\\ninform others.\\nFinally, history may affect the content of the text. In mes-\\nsage boards, prior posts may shape future posts; if someone\\nraised a point in a previous post, the respondent will most likely\\nrefer to the point in future posts. If retweets are included in an\\nanalysis, this will bias content toward most circulated posts.\\nMore broadly, media frames such as #metoo or #blacklives-\\nmatter might make some concepts or facts more accessible to\\nspeakers and therefore more likely to emerge in text, even if\\nseemingly unrelated (McCombs and Shaw 1972; Xiong, Cho,\\nand Boatwright 2019).\\nUsing Text for Prediction Versus\\nUnderstanding\\nBeyond reflecting information about the text creator and\\nshaping outcomes for the text recipient, another useful dis-\\ntinction is whether text is used for prediction or\\nunderstanding.\\nPrediction\\nSome text research is predominantly interested in prediction.\\nWhich customer is most likely to default on their loan (Netzer,\\nLemaire, and Herzenstein 2019)? Which movie will sell the\\nmost tickets (Eliashberg et al. 2014)? How will the stock mar-\\nket perform (Bollen, Mao, and Zeng 2011; Tirunillai and Tellis\\n2012)? Whether focusing on individual-, firm-, or market-level\\noutcomes, the goal is to predict with the highest degree of\\naccuracy. Such work often takes many textual features and uses\\nmachine learning or other methods to combine these features in\\na way that achieves the best prediction. The authors care less\\n2 Note that intermediaries can amplify (e.g., retweet) an original message and\\nmay have different motivations than the text producer.\\nBerger et al. 5 about any individual feature and more about how the set of\\nobservable features can be combined to predict an outcome.\\nThe main difficulty involved with using text for predictions\\nis that text can generate hundreds and often thousands of fea-\\ntures (words) that are all potential predictors for the outcome of\\ninterest. In some cases, the number of predictors is larger than\\nthe number of observations, making traditional statistical pre-\\ndictive models largely impractical. To address this issue,\\nresearchers often resort to machine learning–type methods, but\\noverfitting needs to be carefully considered. In addition, infer-\\nence with respect to the role of each word in the prediction can\\nbe difficult. Methods such as feature importance weighing can\\nhelp extract some inference from these predictive models.\\nUnderstanding\\nOther research is predominantly interested in using text for\\nunderstanding. How does the language consumers use shape\\nword of mouth’s impact (Packard and Berger 2017)? Why do\\nsome online posts get shared, songs become popular, or\\nbrands engender greater loyalty? How do cultural attitudes\\nor business practices change? Whether focusing on\\nindividual-, firm-, or market-level outcomes, the goal is to\\nunderstand why or how something occurred. Such work often\\ninvolves examining only one or a small number of textual\\nfeatures or aspects that link to underlying psychological or\\nsociological processes and aims to understand which features\\nare driving outcomes and why.\\nOne challenge with using textual data for understanding\\nis drawing causal inferences from observational data. Con-\\nsequently, work in this area may augment field data with\\nexperiments to allow key independent variables to be\\nmanipulated. Another challenge is interpreting relationships\\nwith textual features (we discuss this further in the closing\\nsection). Songs that use more second-person pronouns are\\nmore popular (Packard and Berger 2019b), for example, but\\nthis relationship alone doesnot necessarily explain why this\\nis the case; second-person pronouns may indicate several\\nthings. Consequently, deeper t heorizing, examination of\\nlinks observed in prior research, or further empirical work\\nis often needed.\\nNote that research that can use either a prediction or\\nunderstanding lens to study either what text reflects or what\\nit impacts. On the prediction side, researchers interested in\\nwhat text reflects could use it to predict states or traits of\\nthe text creator such as customer satisfaction, likelihood of\\nchurn, or brand personality. Researchers interested in the\\nimpact of text could predict how text will shape outcomes\\nsuch as reading behavior, sharing, or purchase among con-\\nsumers of that text.\\nOn the understanding side, someone interested in what text\\nreflects could use it to shedlight on why people might use\\ncertain personal pronouns when they are depressed or why\\ncustomers might use certain types of emotional language\\nwhen they are talking to customer service. Someone inter-\\nested in the impact of text could use it to understand why text\\nthat evokes different emotions might be more likely to be read\\nor shared.\\nFurthermore, while most research tends to focus on either\\nprediction or understanding, some work integrates both\\naspects. Netzer, Lemaire, and Herzenstein (2019), for example,\\nboth use a range of available textual features to predict whether\\na given person will default on a loan and analyze the specific\\nlanguage used by people who tend to default (e.g., language\\nused by liars).\\nUniting the Tribes of Marketing\\nRegardless of whether the focus is on text reflection versus\\nimpact, or prediction versus understanding, doing text analysis\\nwell requires integrating skills, techniques, and substantive\\nknowledge from different areas of marketing. Furthermore,\\ntextual analysis opens up a wealth of opportunity for each of\\nthese areas as well.\\nTake consumer behavior. While hypothetical scenarios can\\nbe useful, behavioral economics has recently gotten credit for\\nmany applications of social or cognitive psychology because\\nthese researchers have demonstrated phenomena in the field.\\nGiven concerns about replication, researchers have started to\\nlook for new tools that enable them to ensure validity and\\nincrease relevance to external audiences. Previously, use of\\nsecondary data was often limited because it addressed the\\n“what” but not the “why” (i.e., what people bought or did, but\\nnot why they did so). But text can provide a window into the\\nunderlying process. Online reviews, for example, can be used\\nto understand why someone bought one thing rather than\\nanother. Blog posts can help marketers understand consider-\\nation sets (Lee and Bradlow 2011; Netzer et al. 2012) and the\\ncustomer journey (Li and Du 2011). Text even helps address\\nthe age-old issue of telling more than we can know (Nisbett and\\nWilson 1977). While people may not always know why they\\ndid something, their language often provides traces of explana-\\ntion (Pennebaker 2011), even beyond what they can con-\\nsciously articulate.\\nThis richness is attractive to more than just behavioral\\nresearchers. Text opens a large-scale window into the world\\nof “why” in the field and does so in a scalable manner. Quan-\\ntitative modelers are always looking for new data sources and\\ntools to explain and predict behavior. Unstructured data pro-\\nvides a rich set of predictors that are often readily available, at\\nlarge scale, and able to be combined with structured measures\\nas either dependent variables or independent variables. Text,\\nthrough product reviews, user-driven social media activity, and\\nfirm-driven marketing efforts, provides data in real time that\\ncan shed light on consumer needs/preferences. This offers an\\nalternative or supplement to traditional marketing research\\ntools. In many cases, text can be retraced to an individual,\\nallowing distinction between individual differences and\\ndynamics. It also offers a playground where new methodolo-\\ngies from other disciplines can be applied (e.g., deep learning;\\nLeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015; Liu et al. 2019).\\n6 Journal of Marketing 84(1) Marketing strategy researchers want logic by which business\\ncan achieve its marketing objectives and to better understand\\nwhat affects organizational success. A primary challenge to\\nthese researchers is to obtain reliable and generalizable survey\\nor field data about factors that lie deep in the firm’s culture and\\nstructure or that are housed in the mental models and beliefs of\\nmarketing leaders and employees. Text analysis offers an objec-\\ntive and systematic solution to assess constructs in naturally\\noccurring data (e.g., letters to shareholders, press releases, patent\\ntext, marketing messages, conference calls with analysts) that\\nmay be more valid. Likewise, marketing strategy scholars often\\nstruggle with valid measures of a firm’s marketing assets, and\\ntext may be a useful tool to understand the nature of customer,\\npartner, and employee relationships and the strength of brand\\nsentiments. For example, Ku¨bler, Colicev, and Pauwels (2017)\\nuse dictionaries and support vector machine methods to extract\\nsentiment and relate it to consumer mindset metrics.\\nScholars who draw from anthropology and sociology have\\nlong examined text through qualitative interpretation and con-\\ntent analysis. Consumer cultu re theory–oriented marketing\\nresearchers are primarily interested in understanding underly-\\ning meanings, norms, and values of consumers, firms, and\\nmarkets in the marketplace. Text analysis provides a tool for\\nquantifying qualitative information to measure changes over\\ntime or make comparisons between groups. Sociological and\\nanthropological researchers can use automated text analysis to\\nidentify important words, locate themes, link them to text seg-\\nments, and examine common expressions in their context. For\\nexample, to understand consumer taste practices, Arsel and\\nBean (2013) use text analysis to first identify how consumers\\ntalk about different taste objects, doings, and meanings in their\\ntextual data set (comments on a website/blog) before analyzing\\nthe relationship between these elements using interview data.\\nFor marketing practitioners, textual analysis unlocks the\\nvalue of unstructured data and offers a hybrid between quali-\\ntative and quantitative marketing research. Like qualitative\\nresearch, it is rich, exploratory, and can answer the “why,” but\\nlike quantitative research, it benefits from scalability, which\\noften permits modeling and statistical testing. Textual analysis\\nenables researchers to explore open-ended questions for which\\nthey do not know the range of possible answers a priori. With\\ntext, scholars can answer questions that they did not ask or for\\nwhich they did not know the right outcome measure. Rather\\nthan forcing on participants a certain scale or set of outcomes\\nfrom which to select, for example, marketing researchers can\\ninstead ask participants broad questions, such as why they like\\nor dislike something, and then use topic modeling tools such as\\nlatent Dirichlet allocation (LDA; explained in detail subse-\\nquently) to discover the key underlying themes.\\nImportantly, while text analysis offers opportunities for a\\nvariety of research tradition s, such opportunities are more\\nlikely to be realized when researchers work across traditional\\nsubgroups. That is, the benefits of computer-aided text analysis\\nare best realized if we include both quantitative, positivist\\nanalyses of content and qualitative, interpretive analyses of\\ndiscourse. Quantitative researchers, for example, have the\\nskills to build the right statistical models, but they can benefit\\nfrom behavioral and qualitative researchers’ ability to link\\nwords to underlying psychological or social processes as well\\nas marketing strategy researchers’ understanding of organiza-\\ntional and marketing activities driving firm performance. This\\nis true across all of the groups.\\nThus, to really extract insights from textual data, research\\nteams must have the interpretative skills to understand the\\nmeaning of words, the behavioral skills to link them to under-\\nlying psychological processes, the quantitative skills to build\\nthe right statistical models, and the strategy skills to understand\\nwhat these findings mean for firm actions and outcomes. We\\noutline some potential areas fo r fruitful collaboration in\\n“Future Research Agenda” section.\\nText Analysis Tools, Methods, and Metrics\\nGiven the recent work using text analysis to derive marketing\\ninsight, some researchers may wonder where to start. This\\nsection reviews methodologies often used in text-based\\nresearch. These include techniques needed to convert text into\\nconstructs in the research process as well as procedures needed\\nto incorporate extracted textual information into subsequent\\nmodeling and analyses. The objective of this section is not to\\nprovide a comprehensive tutorial but, rather, to expose the\\nreader to available techniques, discuss when different methods\\nare appropriate, and highlight some of the key considerations in\\napplying each method.\\nThe process of text analysis involves several steps: (1) data\\npreprocessing, (2) performing atext analysis of the resulting\\ndata, (3) converting the text into quantifiable measures, and\\n(4) assessing the validity of the extracted text and measures.\\nEach of these steps may vary depending on the research objec-\\ntive. Table 2 provides a summary of the different steps\\ninvolved in the text analysis process from preprocessing to com-\\nmonly used tools and measures and validation approaches. Table\\n2 can serve as a starter kit for those taking their first steps with\\ntext analysis.\\nData Preprocessing\\nText is often unstructured and “messy,” so before any formal\\nanalyses can take place, researchers must first preprocess the\\ntext itself. This step provides structure and consistency so that\\nthe text can be used systematically in the scientific process.\\nCommon software tools for text analysis include Python (https://\\nwww.nltk.org/) and R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/\\nquanteda/quanteda.pdf, https://quanteda.io/). For both software\\nplatforms, a set of relatively easy-to-use tools has been devel-\\noped to perform most of the data preprocessing steps. Some\\nprograms, such as Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC;\\nTausczik and Pennebaker 2010) and WordStat (Peladeau 2016),\\nrequire minimal preprocessing. We detail the data preprocessing\\nsteps next (for a summary of the steps, see Table 3).\\nBerger et al. 7 Data acquisition. Data acquisition can be well defined if the\\nresearcher is provided with a set of documents (e.g., emails,\\nquarterly reports, a data set of product reviews) or more open-\\nended if the researcher is using a web scraper (e.g., Beautiful\\nSoup) that searches the web for instances of a particular topic\\nor a specific product. When scraping text from public sources,\\nresearchers should abide by the legal guidelines for using the\\ndata for academic or commercial purposes.\\nTokenization. Tokenization is the process of breaking the text into\\nunits (often words and sentences). When tokenizing, the\\nresearcher needs to determine the delimiters that define a token\\n(space, period, semicolon, etc.). If, for example, a space or a period\\nis used to determine a word, it may produce some nonsensical\\ntokens. For example, “the U.S.” may be broken to the tokens “the,”\\n“U,” and “S.” Most text-mining software has smart tokenization\\nprocedures to alleviate such common problems, but the\\nresearcher should pay close atten t i o nt oi n s t a n c e st h a ta r es p e -\\ncific to the textual corpora. For cases that include paragraphs or\\nthreads, depending on the research objective, the researcher\\nmay wish to tokenize these larger units of text as well.\\nCleaning. HTML tags and nontextual information, such as\\nimages, are cleaned or removed from the data set. The cleaning\\nneeds may depend on the format in which the data was provided/\\nextracted. Data extracted from the web often requires heavier\\ncleaning due to the presence of HTML tags. Depending on the\\npurpose of the analysis, images and other nontextual information\\nmay be retained. Contractions such as “isn’t” and “can’t” need to\\nbe expanded at this step. In this step, researchers should also be\\nmindful of and remove phrases automatically generated by com-\\nputers that may occur within the text (e.g., “html”).\\nRemoving stop words.Stop words are common words such as “a”\\nand “the” that appear in most documents but often provide no\\nsignificant meaning. Common text-mining tools (e.g., the tm,\\nquanteda, tidytext, and tokenizers package in R; the Natural\\nLanguage Toolkit package in Python; exclusion words in\\nWordStat) have a predefined list of such stop words that can\\nbe amended by the researcher. It is advisable to add common\\nwords that are specific to the domain (e.g., “Amazon” in a\\ncorpora of Amazon reviews) to this list. Depending on the\\nresearch objective, stop words can sometimes be very mean-\\ningful, and researchers may wish to retain them for their anal-\\nysis. For example, if the researcher is interested in extracting\\nnot only the content of the text but also writing style (e.g.,\\nPackard, Moore, and McFerran 2018), stop words can be very\\ninformative (Pennebaker 2011).\\nSpelling. Most text-mining packages have prepackaged spellers\\nthat can help correct spelling mistakes (e.g., the Enchant spel-\\nler). In using these spellers, the researcher should be aware of\\nlanguage that is specific to the domain and may not appear in\\nthe speller—or even worse, that the speller may incorrectly\\n“fix.” Moreover, for some analyses the researcher may want\\nto record the number of spelling mistakes as an additional\\nTable 2.The Text Analysis Workflow.\\nData Preprocessing Common Tools Measurement Validity\\n/C15 Data acquisition:\\nObtain or download\\n(often in an HTML\\nformat) text.\\n/C15 Tokenization: Break\\ntext into units (often\\nwords and sentences)\\nusing delimiters (e.g.,\\nperiods).\\n/C15 Cleaning: Remove\\nnonmeaningful text (e.g.,\\nHTML tags) and\\nnontextual information.\\n/C15 Removing stop words:\\nEliminate common\\nwords such as “a” or\\n“the” that appear in\\nmost documents.\\n/C15 Spelling: Correct\\nspelling mistakes using\\ncommon spellers.\\n/C15 Stemming and\\nlemmatization: Reduce\\nwords into their\\ncommon stem or lemma.\\n/C15 Entity extraction: Tools used to\\nextract the meaning of one word\\nat a time or simple cooccurrence\\nof words.

Lemmatization is similar to stem-\\nming, but it returns the proper lemma as opposed to the word’s root,\\nwhich may not be a meaningful word. For example, with stem-\\nming, the entities “car” and “cars” are stemmed to “car,” but\\n“automobile” is not. In lemmatization, the words “car,” “cars,”\\nand “automobile” are all reduced to the lemma “automobile.”\\nSeveral prepackaged stemmers exist in most text-mining tools\\n(e.g., the Porter stemmer). Similar to stop words, if the goal of the\\nanalysis is to extract the writing style, one may wish to skip the\\nstemming step, because stemming often masks the tense used.\\nText Analysis Extraction\\nOnce the data has been preprocessed, the researcher can start\\nanalyzing the data. One can distinguish between the extraction\\nof individual words or phrases (entity extraction), the extrac-\\ntion of themes or topics from the collective set of words or\\nphrases in the text (topic extraction), and the extraction of\\nrelationships between words or phrases (relation extraction).\\nTable 4 highlights these three types of analysis, the typical\\nresearch questions investigated with each approach, and some\\ncommonly used tools.\\nEntity (word) extraction.At the most basic level, text mining has\\nbeen used in marketing to extract individual entities (i.e., count\\nwords) such as person, location, brands, product attributes, emo-\\ntions, and adjectives. Entity extraction is probably the most\\ncommonly used text analysis approach in marketing academia\\nand practice, partly due to its relative simplicity. It allows the\\nresearcher to explore both what was written (the content of the\\nwords) as well as how it was written (the writing style). Entity\\nextraction can be used (1) to monitor discussions on social media\\n(e.g., numerous commercial companies offer buzz monitoring\\nservices and use entity extraction to track how frequently a brand\\nis being mentioned across alternative social media), (2) to gen-\\nerate a rich set of entities (words) to be used in a predictive\\nmodel (e.g., which words or entities are associated with fake\\nor fraudulent statements), and (3) as input to be used with dic-\\ntionaries to extract more complex forms of textual expressions,\\nsuch as a particular concept, sentiment, emotion, or writing style.\\nIn addition to programming languages such as Python and\\nR’s tm tool kits, software packages such as WordStat make it\\npossible to extract entities without coding. Entity extraction\\ncan also serve as input in commonly used dictionaries or lex-\\nicons. Dictionaries (i.e., a predefined list of words, such as a list\\nof brand names) are often used to classify entities into the\\ncategories (e.g., concepts, brands, people, categories, loca-\\ntions). In more formal text, capitalization can be used to help\\nTable 3.Data Preprocessing Steps.\\nData Processing Step Issues to Consider Illustration\\nData acquisition /C15 Is the data readily available in textual format or does the\\nresearch needs to use a web scraper to find the data?\\n/C15 What are the legal guidelines for using the data\\n(particularly relevant for web-scraped data)?\\nTweets mentioning different brands from the same\\ncategory during a particular time frame are\\ndownloaded from Twitter.\\nTokenization /C15 What is the unit of analysis (word, sentence, thread,\\nparagraph)?\\n/C15 Use smart tokenization for delimiters and adjust to\\nspecific unique delimiters found in the corpora.\\nThe unit of analysis is the individual tweet.

However, in more casual\\ntext, such as social media, such signals are less useful. Com-\\nmon dictionaries include LIWC (Pennebaker et al. 2015), EL\\n2.0 (Rocklage, Rucker, and Nordgren 2018), Diction 5.0, or\\nGeneral Inquirer for psychological states and traits (for exam-\\nple applications, see Berger and Milkman [2012]; Ludwig et al.\\n[2013]; Netzer, Lemaire, and Herzenstein [2019]).\\nSentiment dictionaries such as Hedonometer (Dodds et al.\\n2011), VADER (Hutto and Gilbert 2014), and LIWC can be used\\nto extract the sentiment of the text. One of the major limitations of\\nthe lexical approaches for sentiment analysis commonly used in\\nmarketing is that they apply a “bag of words” approach—meaning\\nt h a tw o r do r d e rd o e sn o tm a t t e r — a n dr e l ys o l e l yo nt h ec o o c c u r -\\nrence of a word of interest (e.g., “brand”) with positive or negative\\nwords (e.g., “great,” “bad”) in the same textual unit (e.g., a\\nreview). While dictionary approaches may be an easy way to\\nmeasure constructs and comparability across data sets, machine\\nlearning approaches trained by human-coded data (e.g., Borah and\\nTellis 2016; Hartmann et al. 2018; Hennig-Thurau, Wiertz, and\\nFeldhaus 2015) tend to be the most accurate way of measuring\\nsuch constructs (Hartmann et al. 2019), particularly if the construct\\nis complex or the domain is uncommon. For this reason, research-\\ners should carefully weigh the trade-off between empirical fit and\\ntheoretical commensurability, taking care to validate any diction-\\naries used in the analysis (discussed in the next section).\\nA specific type of entity extraction includes linguistic-type\\nentities such as part-of-speech tagging, which assigns a linguis-\\ntic tag (e.g., verb, noun, adjective) to each entity. Most text\\nanalysis tools (e.g., the tm package in R, the Natural Language\\nToolkit package in Python) have a built-in part-of-speech tag-\\nging tool. If no predefined dictionary exists, or the dictionary is\\nnot sufficient for the extraction needed, one could add hand-\\ncrafted rules to help define entities. However, the list of rules\\ncan become long, and the task of identifying and writing the\\nrules can be tedious. If the entity extraction by dictionaries or\\nrules is difficult or if the entities are less defined, machine\\nlearning–supervised classification approaches (e.g., condi-\\ntional random fields [Netzer et al. 2012], hidden Markov\\nmodels) or deep learning (Timoshenko and Hauser 2019) can\\nbe used to extract entities. Thelimitation of this approach is\\nthat often a relatively large hand-coded training data set needs\\nto be generated.\\nTo allow for a combination of words, entities can be defined\\nas a set of consecutive words, often referred to as n-grams,\\nwithout attempting to extract the relationship between these\\nentities (e.g., the consecutive words “credit card” can create\\nthe unigram entities “credit” and “card” as well as the bigram\\n“credit card”). This can be useful if the researcher is interested\\nin using the text as input for a predictive model.\\nIf the researcher wishes to extract entities while understanding\\nthe context in which the entities were mentioned in the text (thus\\navoiding the limitation of the bag-of-words approach), the emer-\\nging set of tools of word2vec or word embedding (Mikolov et al.\\n2013) can be employed. Word2vec maps each word or entity to a\\nvector of latent dimensions called embedding vector based on the\\nwords with which each focal word appears. This approach allows\\nthe researcher not only to extract words but also to understand the\\nsimilarity between words based on the similarities between the\\nembedding vectors (or the similarities between the sentences in\\nwhich each word appears). Thus, unlike the previous approaches\\ndiscussed thus far, word2vec preserves the context in which the\\nword appeared. While word embedding statistically captures the\\ncontext in which a word appears, it does not directly linguistically\\n“understand” the relationships among words.\\nTopic modeling.Entity extraction has two major limitations: (1)\\nthe dimensionality of the problem (often thousands of unique\\nentities are extracted) and (2) the interpretation of many enti-\\nties. Several topic modeling approaches have been suggested to\\novercome these limitations. Similar to how factor analysis\\nidentifies underlying themes among different survey items,\\ntopic modeling can identify the general topics (described as a\\ncombination of words) that are discussed in a body of text. This\\ntext summarization approach increases understanding of docu-\\nment content and is particularly useful when the objective is\\ninsight generation and interpretation rather than prediction\\n(e.g., Berger and Packard 2018; Tirunillai and Tellis 2014).\\nIn addition, monitoring topics, as opposed to words, makes it\\neasier to assess how discussion changes over time (e.g., Zhong\\nand Schweidel 2019).\\nMethodologically, topic modeling mimics the data-\\ngenerating process in which the writer chooses the topic she\\nwants to write about and then chooses the words to express\\nthese topics. Topics are defined as word distributions that com-\\nmonly co-occur and thus have a certain probability of appear-\\ning in a topic. A document is then described as a probabilistic\\nmixture of topics.\\nThe two most commonly used tools for topic modeling are\\nLDA (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003)and Poisson factorization\\n(PF; Gopalan, Hofman and Blei 2013). The predominant\\napproach prior to LDA and PF was the support-vector-\\nmachine latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach. While LSA\\nis simpler and faster to implement than LDA and PF, it\\nrequires larger textual corpora and often achieves lower accu-\\nracy levels. Other approaches include building an ontology of\\ntopics using a combination of human classification of docu-\\nments as seeding for a machine learning classification (e.g.,\\nMoon and Kamakura 2017). Whereas LDA is often simpler to\\napply than PF, PF has the advantage of not assuming that the\\ntopic probabilities must sum toone. That is, some documents\\nmay have more topic presences than others, and a document\\ncan have multiple topics with high likelihood of occurrence.\\nIn addition, PF tends to be more stable with shorter text.\\nBu¨schken and Allenby (2016) relax the common bag-of-\\nwords assumption underlying the traditional LDA model and\\nleverage the within-sentence dependencies of online reviews.\\nLDA2vec is another approach toassess topics while account-\\ning for the sequence context in which the word appears\\n(Moody 2016). In the context of search queries, Liu and Tou-\\nbia (2018) further extend the LDA approach to hierarchical\\nLDA for cases in which related documents (queries and search\\nresults) are used to extract the topics. Furthermore, the\\nBerger et al. 11 researcher can use an unsupervised or seeded LDA approach\\nto incorporate prior knowledge in the construction and inter-\\npretation of the topics (e.g., Puranam, Narayan, and Kadiyali\\n2017; Toubia et al. 2019).\\nWhile topic modeling methods often produce very sensible\\ntopics, because topics are selected solely based on a statistical\\napproach, the selection of the number of topics and the inter-\\npretation of some topics can be challenging. It is recommended\\nto combine statistical approaches (e.g., the perplexity measure,\\nwhich is a model fit–based measure) and researcher judgment\\nwhen selecting the number of topics.\\nRelation extraction. At the most basic level, relationships\\nbetween entities can be captured by the mere co-occurrence\\nof entities (e.g., Boghrati and Berger 2019; Netzer et al.\\n2012; Toubia and Netzer 2017). However, marketing research-\\ners are often more interested in identifying textual relationships\\namong extracted entities, such as the relationships between\\nproducts, attributes, and sentiments. Such relationships are\\noften more relevant for the firm than merely measuring the\\nvolume of brand mentions or even the overall brand sentiment.\\nFor example, researchers may want to identify whether consu-\\nmers mentioned a particular problem with a specific product\\nfeature. Feldman et al. (2015) and Netzer et al. (2012) provide\\nsuch examples by identifying the textual relationships between\\ndrugs and adverse drug reactions that imply that a certain drug\\nmay cause a particular adverse reaction.\\nRelation extraction also offers a more advanced route to\\ncapture sentiment by providing the link between an entity of\\ninterest (e.g., a brand) and the sentiment expressed, beyond\\ntheir mere cooccurrence. Relation extraction based on the\\nbag-of-words approach, which treats the sentence as a bag\\nof unsorted words and searches for word cooccurrence, is\\nlimited because the cooccurrence of words may not imply a\\nrelationship. For example, the cooccurrence of a drug (e.g.,\\nAdvil) with a symptom (e.g., headache) may refer to the\\nsymptom as a side effect of the drug or as the effect the drug\\nis aiming to alleviate. Addressing such relationships requires\\nidentifying the sequence of words and the linguistic relation-\\nship among them. There have been only limited applications\\nof such relation extraction in marketing, primarily due to the\\ncomputational and linguistic complexities involved in accu-\\nrately making such relational inferences from unstructured\\ndata (see, e.g., the diabetes drugs application in Netzer et al.\\n[2012]). However, as the methodologies used to extract entity\\nrelations evolve, we expect thisto be a promising direction for\\nmarketers to take.\\nThe most commonly used approaches for relation extraction\\nare handwritten relationship rules, supervised machine learning\\napproaches, and a combination of these approaches. At the\\nmost basic level, the researcher could write a set of rules that\\ndescribe the required relationship. An example of such a rule\\nmay be the co-occurrence of product (e.g., “Ford”), attribute\\n(e.g., “oil consumption”), and problem (e.g., “excessive”).\\nHowever, such approaches tend to require many handwritten\\nrules and have low recall (they miss many relations) and thus\\nare becoming less popular.\\nA more common approach is to train a supervised machine\\nlearning tool. This could be linguistic agnostic approaches\\n(e.g., deep learning) or natural language processing (NLP)\\napproaches that aim to understand the linguisticrelationship\\nin the sentence. Such an approach requires a relatively large\\ntraining data set provided by human coders in which various\\nrelationships (e.g., sentim ent) are observed. One readily\\navailable tool for NLP-based relationship extraction is the\\nStanford Sentence and Grammatical Dependency Parser\\n(http://nlp.stanf ord.edu:8080/parser/). The tool identifies the\\ngrammatical role of different words in the sentence to identify\\ntheir relationship. For example, to assign a sentiment to a\\nparticular attribute, the parser first identifies the presence of\\nan emotion word and then, in cases where a subject is present,\\nautomatically assesses if there is a grammatical relationship\\n(e.g., in the sentence “the hotelwas very nice,” the adjective\\n“nice” relates to the subject “hotel”). As with many off-the-\\nshelf tools, the validity of the tool for a specific relation\\nextraction needs to be tested.\\nFinally, beyond the relations between words/entities within\\none document, text can also be investigated across documents\\n(e.g., online reviews, academic articles). For example, a tem-\\nporal sequence of documents or a portfolio of documents across\\na group or community of communicators can be examined for\\ninterdependencies (Ludwig et al. 2013, 2014).\\nText Analysis Metrics\\nEarly work in marketing has tended to summarize unstructured\\ntext with structured proxies for this data. For example, in online\\nreviews, researchers have used volume (e.g., Godes and Mayzlin\\n2004; Moe and Trusov 2011); valence, often captured by numeric\\nratings that supplement the text (e.g., Godes and Silva 2012; Moe\\nand Schweidel 2012; Ying, Feinberg and Wedel 2006); and var-\\niance, often captured using entropy-type measures (e.g., Godes\\nand Mayzlin 2004). However, these quantifiable metrics often\\nmask the richness of the text. Several common metrics are often\\nused to quantify the text itself, as we explain next.\\nCount measures.Count measures have been used to measure the\\nfrequency of each entity’s occurrence, entities’ co-occurrence,\\nor entities’ relations. For example, when using dictionaries to\\nevaluate sentiment or other categories, researchers often use\\nthe proportion of negative and/or positive words in the docu-\\nment, or the difference between the two (Berger and Milkman\\n2012; Borah and Tellis 2016; Pennebaker et al. 2015; Schwei-\\ndel and Moe 2014; Tirunillai and Tellis 2014). The problem\\nwith simple counts is that longer documents are likely to\\ninclude more occurrences of every entity. For that reason,\\nresearchers often focus on the proportions of words in the\\ndocument that belong to a particular category (e.g., positive\\nsentiment). The limitation of this simple measure is that some\\nwords are more likely to appear than others. For example, the\\n12 Journal of Marketing 84(1) word “laptop” is likely to appear in almost every review in\\ncorpora that is composed of laptop reviews.\\nAccuracy measures. When evaluating the accuracy of text mea-\\nsures relative to human-coded or externally validated docu-\\nments, measures of recall and precision are often used.\\nRecall is the proportion of entities in the original text that the\\ntext-mining algorithm was able to successfully identify (it is\\ndefined by the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives\\nand false negatives). Precision is the proportion of correctly\\nidentified entities from all entities identified (it is defined by\\nthe ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false\\npositives). On their own, recall and precision measures are\\ndifficult to assess because an improvement in one often comes\\nat the expense of the other. For example, if one defines that\\nevery entity in the corpora is a brand, recall for brands will be\\nperfect (you will never miss a brand if it exists in the text), but\\nprecision will be very low (there will be many false positive\\nidentifications of a brand entity).\\nTo create the balance between recall and precision, one can\\nuse the F1 measure—a harmonic mean of the levels of recall\\nand precision. If the researcher is more concerned with false\\npositives than false negatives (e.g., it is more important to\\nidentify positives than negatives), recall and precision can be\\nweighted differently. Alternatively, for unbalanced data with\\nhigh proportions of true or false in the populations, a receiver\\noperating characteristics curve can be used to reflect the rela-\\ntionship between true positives and false positives, and the area\\nunder the curve is often used as a measure of accuracy.\\nSimilarity measures.In some cases, the researcher is interested in\\nmeasuring the similarity between documents (e.g., Ludwig\\net al. 2013). How similar is the language used in two adver-\\ntisements? How different is a song from its genre? In such\\ncases, measures such as linguistic style matching, similarity\\nin topic use (Berger and Packard 2018), cosine similarity, and\\nthe Jaccard index (e.g., Toubia and Netzer 2017) can be used to\\nassess the similarity between the text of two documents.\\nReadability measures.In some cases, the researcher is interested\\nin evaluating the readability of the text. Readability can reflect\\nthe sophistication of the writer and/or the ability of the reader to\\ncomprehend the text (e.g., Ghose and Ipeirotis 2011). Common\\nreadability measures include the Flesch–Kincaid reading ease\\nand the simple measure of gobbledygook (SMOG) measures.\\nThese measures often use metrics such as average number of\\nsyllables and average number of words per sentence to evaluate\\nthe readability of the text. Readability measures often grade the\\ntext on a 1–12 scale reflecting the U.S. school grade-level\\nneeded to comprehend the text. Common text-mining packages\\nhave built-in readability tools.\\nThe Validity of Text-Based Constructs\\nWhile the availability of text has opened up a range of research\\nquestions, for textual data to provide value, one must be able to\\nestablish its validity. Both internal validity (i.e., does text\\naccurately measure the constructs and the relationship between\\nthem?) and external validity (i.e., do the test-based findings\\napply to phenomena outside the study?) can be established in\\nvarious ways (Humphreys and Wang 2017). Table 5 describes\\nhow the text analysis can be evaluated to improve different\\ntypes of validity (Cook and Campbell 1979).\\nInternal Validity\\nInternal validity is often a major threat in the context of text\\nanalysis because the mapping between words and the underly-\\ning dimension the research aims to measure (e.g., psychologi-\\ncal state and traits) is rarely straightforward and can vary across\\ncontexts and textual outlets (e.g., formal news vs. social\\nmedia). In addition, given the relatively young field of auto-\\nmated text analysis, validation of many of the methods and\\nconstructs is still ongoing.\\nAccordingly, it is important to confirm the internal validity\\nof the approach used. A range of methods can be adopted to\\nensure construct, concurrent, convergent, discriminant, and\\ncausal validity. In general, the approach for ensuring internal\\nvalidity is to ensure that the text studied accurately reflects the\\ntheoretical concept or topic being studied, does so in a way that\\nis congruent with prior literature, is discriminant from other\\nrelated constructs, and provides ample and careful evidence for\\nthe claims of the research.\\nConstruct validity.Construct validity (i.e., does the text represent\\nthe theoretical concept?) is perhaps the most important to\\naddress when studying text. Threats to construct validity occur\\nwhen the text provides improper or misleading evidence of the\\nconstruct. For instance, researchers often rely on existing stan-\\ndardized dictionaries to extract constructs to ensure that their\\nwork is comparable with other work. However, these diction-\\naries may not always fit the particular context. For example,\\nextracting sentiment from financial reports using sentiment\\ntools developed for day-to-day language may not be appropri-\\nate. Particularly when attempting to extract complex constructs\\n(e.g., psychological states and traits, relationships between con-\\nsumers and products, and even sentiment), researchers should\\nattempt to validate the constructs on the specific application to\\nensure that what is being extracted from the text is indeed what\\nthey intended to extract. Construct validity can also be chal-\\nlenged when homonyms or other words do not accurately\\nreflect what researchers think they do.\\nStrategies for addressing threats to construct validity require\\nthat researchers examine how the instances counted in the data\\nconnect to the theoretical concept(s) (Humphreys and Wang\\n2017). Dictionaries can also be validated using a saturation\\napproach, pulling a subsample of coded entries and verifying\\nwith a hit rate of approximately 80% (Weber 2005). Another\\nmethod is to use input from human coders, as is done to support\\nmachine learning applications (as previously discussed). For\\nexample, one can use Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to\\nlabel phrases on a scale from “very negative” to “very positive”\\nfor sentiment analysis and then use these words to create a\\nBerger et al. 13 weighted dictionary. In many cases, multiple methods for dic-\\ntionary validation are advisable to ensure that one is achieving\\nboth theoretical and empirical fit. For topic modeling, research-\\ners infer topics from a list of cooccurring words. However,\\nthese are theoretical inferences made by researchers. As such,\\nconstruct validity is equally important and can be ascertained\\nusing some of the same methods of validation, through satura-\\ntion and calculating a hit rate through manual analysis of a\\nsubset of the data. When using a classification approach, con-\\nfusion matrices can be produced to provide details on accuracy,\\nfalse positives, and false negatives (Das and Chen 2007).\\nConcurrent validity. Concurrent validity concerns the way that\\nthe researcher’s operationalization of the construct relates to\\nprior operationalizations. Threats to concurrent validity often\\ncome when researchers create text-based measures inductively\\nfrom the text. For instance, if one develops a topic model from\\nthe text, it will be based on the data set and may not therefore\\nproduce topics that are comparable with previous research. To\\naddress these threats, one should compare the operationaliza-\\ntion with other research and other data sources. For example,\\nSchweidel and Moe (2014) propose a measure of brand senti-\\nment based on social media text data and validate it by\\nTable 5.Text Analysis Validation Techniques.\\nType of Validity Validation Technique Description of Method for Validation References\\nInternal Validity\\nConstruct validity Dictionary validation After draft dictionary is created, pull 10% of the sample\\nand calculate the hit rate. Measures such as hit rates,\\nprecision, and recall can be used to measure accuracy.\\nWeber (2005)\\nHave survey participants rate words included in the\\ndictionary. Based on this data, the dictionary can also\\nbe weighted to reflect the survey data.\\nBrysbaert, Warriner, and\\nKuperman (2014)a\\nHave three coders evaluate the dictionary categories. If\\ntwo of the three coders agree that the word is part of\\nthe category, include; if not, exclude. Calculate overall\\nagreement.\\nHumphreys (2010);\\nPennebaker, Francis, and\\nBooth (2001)a\\nSaturation Pull 10% of instances coded from the data and calculate\\nthe hit rate. Adjust word list until saturation reaches\\n80% hit rate.\\nWeber (2005)\\nConcurrent validity Multiple dictionaries Calculate and compare multiple textual measures of the\\nsame construct (e.g., multiple sentiment measures)\\nHartmann et al.

(2014)\\nRobustness Different statistical\\nmeasures, unitizations\\nUse different, but comparable, statistical measures or\\nalgorithms (e.g., lift, cosine similarity, Jaccard\\nsimilarity), aggregate at different levels (e.g., day,\\nmonth)\\nNetzer et al. (2012)\\naReference appears in the Web Appendix.\\n14 Journal of Marketing 84(1) comparing it with brand measures obtained through a tradi-\\ntional marketing research surv ey. Similarly, Netzer et al.\\n(2012) compare the market structure maps derived from textual\\ninformation with those derived from product switching and\\nsurveys, and Tirunillai and Tellis (2014) compare the topics\\nthey identify with those found inConsumer Reports.W h e n\\nstudying linguistic style (Pennebaker and King 1999), for\\nexample, it is beneficial to use robust measures from prior\\nliterature where factor analysis and other methods have already\\nbeen employed to create the construct.\\nConvergent validity. Convergent validity ensures that multiple\\nmeasurements of the construct (i.e., words) all converge to the\\nsame concept. Convergent validity can be threatened when\\nthe measures of the construct do not align or have different\\neffects. Convergent validity can be enhanced by using several\\nsubstantively different measures (e.g., dictionaries) of the\\nsame construct to look for converging patterns. For example,\\nwhen studying posts about the stock market, Das and Chen\\n(2007) compare five classifiers for measuring sentiment,\\nc o m p a r i n gt h e mi nac o n f u s i o nm a t r i xt oe x a m i n ef a l s ep o s i -\\ntives. Convergent evidence can also come from creating a\\ncorrelation or similarity matrix of words or concepts and\\nchecking for patterns that have face validity. For instance,\\nHumphreys (2010) looks for patterns between the concept\\nof crime and negative sentiment to provide convergent evi-\\ndence that crime is negatively valenced in the data.\\nDiscriminant validity. Discriminant validity, the degree to which\\nthe construct measures are sufficiently different from measures\\nof other constructs, can be threatened when the measurement of\\nthe construct is very similar to that of another construct. For\\ninstance, measurements of sentiment and emotion in many\\ncases may not seem different because they are measured using\\nsimilar word lists or, when using classification, return the same\\ngroup of words as predictors. Strategies for ensuring discrimi-\\nnant validity entail looking for discriminant rather than con-\\nvergent patterns and boundary conditions (i.e., when and how\\nis sentiment different from emotion?). Furthermore, theoretical\\nrefinements can be helpful in drawing finer distinctions. For\\nexample, anxiety, anger, and sadness are different kinds of\\nemotion (and can be measured via psychometrically different\\nscales), whereas sentiment is usually measured as positive,\\nnegative, or neutral (Pennebaker et al. 2015).\\nCausal validity. Causal validity is the degree to which the con-\\nstruct, as operationalized in the data set, is actually the cause of\\nanother construct or outcome, and it is best ascertained through\\nrandom assignment in controlled lab conditions. Any number\\nof external factors can threaten causal validity. However, steps\\ncan be taken to enhance causal validity in naturally occurring\\ntextual data. In particular, rival hypotheses and other explana-\\ntory factors for the proposed causal relationship can be statis-\\ntically controlled for in the model. For example, Ludwig et al.\\n(2013) include price discount in the model when studying the\\nrelationship between product reviews and conversion rate to\\ncontrol for this factor.\\nExternal Validity\\nTo achieve external validity, researchers should attempt to\\nensure that the effects found in the text apply outside of the\\nresearch framework. Because text analysis often uses natu-\\nrally occurring data that is often of large magnitude, it tends\\nhave a relatively high degree of external validity relative to,\\nfor example, lab experiments. However, establishing external\\nvalidity is still necessary due to threats to validity from sam-\\npling bias, overfitting, and single-method bias. For example,\\nonline reviews may be biased due to self-selection among\\nthose who elected to review a product (Schoenmu¨ller, Netzer,\\nand Stahl 2019).\\nPredictive validity. Predictive validity is threatened when the\\nconstruct, though perhaps properly measured, does not have\\nthe expected effects on a meaningful second variable. For\\nexample, if consumer sentiment falls but customer satisfac-\\ntion remains high, predictive validity could be called into\\nquestion. To ensure predictive validity, text-based constructs\\ncan be linked to key performance measures such as sales (e.g.,\\nFossen and Schweidel 2019) or consumer engagement (Ash-\\nley and Tuten 2015). If a particular construct has been theo-\\nretically linked to a performancemetric, then any text-based\\nmeasure of that construct should also be linked to that perfor-\\nmance metric. Tirunillai and Tellis (2012) show that the vol-\\nume of Twitter activity affects stock price, but they find\\nmixed results for the predictive validity of sentiment, with\\nnegative sentiment being predictive but positive sentiment\\nhaving no effect.\\nGeneralizability can be threatened when researchers base\\nresults on a single data set because it is unknown whether the\\nfindings, model, or algorithm would apply in the same way to\\nother texts or outside of textual measurements. Generalizability\\nof the results can be established by viewing the results of text\\nanalysis along with other measures of attitude and behavioral\\noutcomes. For example, Netzer et al. (2012) test their substan-\\ntive conclusions and methodology on message boards of both\\nautomobile discussions and drug discussions from WebMD.\\nEvaluating the external validity and generalizability of the\\nfindings is key, because the analysis of text drawn from a\\nparticular source may not reflect consumers more broadly\\n(e.g., Schweidel and Moe 2014).\\nRobustness. Robustness can be limited when there is only one\\nmetric or method used in the model. Researchers can ensure\\nrobustness by using different measures for relationships (e.g.,\\nPearson correlation, cosine similarity, lift) and probing results\\nby relaxing different assumptions. The use of holdout samples\\nand k-fold cross-validation methods can prevent researchers\\nfrom overfitting their models and ensure that relationships\\nfound in the data set will hold with other data as well (Jurafsky\\net al. 2014; see also Humphreys and Wang 2017). Probing on\\nBerger et al. 15 different “cuts” of the data can also help. Berger and Packard\\n(2018), for example, compare lyrics from different genres, and\\nLudwig et al. (2013) include reviews of both fiction and non-\\nfiction books.\\nFinally, researchers should bear in mind the limitations of\\ntext itself. There are thoughts and feelings that consumers,\\nmanagers, or other stakeholders may not express in text. The\\nform of communication (e.g., tweets, annual reports) may also\\nshape the message; some constructs may not be explicit enough\\nto be measured with automated text analysis. Furthermore,\\nwhile textual information can often involve large samples,\\nthese samples may not be representative. Twitter users, for\\nexample, tend to be younger and more educated (Smith and\\nAnderson 2018). Those who contribute textual information,\\nparticularly in social media, may represent polarized points\\nof view. When evaluating cultural products or social media,\\none should consider the system in which they are generated.\\nOften viewpoints are themselves filtered through a cultural\\nsystem (Hirsch 1986; McCracken 1988) or elevated by an algo-\\nrithm, and the products make it through this process may share\\ncertain characteristics. For this reason, researchers and firms\\nshould use caution when making attributions on the basis of a\\ncultural text. It is not necessarily a reflection of reality (Jame-\\nson 2005) but rather may represent ideals, extremes, or insti-\\ntutionalized perceptions, depending on the context.\\nFuture Research Agenda\\nWe hope this article encourages more researchers and practi-\\ntioners to think about how they can incorporate textual data into\\ntheir research. Communication and linguistics are at the core of\\nstudying text in marketing. Automated text analysis opens the\\nblack box of interactions, allowing researchers to directly\\naccess what is being said and how it is said in marketplace\\ncommunication. The notion of text as indicative of meaning-\\nmaking processes creates fascinating and truly novel research\\nquestions and challenges. There are many methods and\\napproaches available, and there is no space to do all of them\\njustice. While we have discussed several research streams,\\ngiven the novelty of text analysis, there are still ample oppor-\\ntunities for future research, which we discuss next.\\nUsing Text to Reach Across the Marketing Discipline\\nReturning to how text analysis can unite the tribes of market-\\ning, it is worth highlighting a few areas that have mostly been\\nexamined by one research tradition in marketing where fruitful\\ncross-pollination between tribes is possible through text anal-\\nysis. Brand communities were first identified and studied by\\nresearchers coming from a sociology perspective (Mun˜iz and\\nO’Guinn 2001). Later, qualitative and quantitative researchers\\nfurther refined the concepts, identifying a distinct set of roles\\nand status in the community (e.g., Mathwick, Wiertz, and De\\nRuyter 2007). Automated text analysis allows researchers to\\nstudy how consumers in these communities interact at scale\\nand in a more quantifiable manner—for instance, examining\\nhow people with different degrees of power use language and\\npredict group outcomes based on quantifiably different\\ndynamics (e.g., Manchanda, Packard, and Pattabhitamaiah\\n2015). Researchers can track influence, for example, by inves-\\ntigating which types of users initiate certain words or phrases\\nand which others pick up on them. Research could examine\\nwhether people begin to enculturate to the language of the\\ncommunity over time and predict which individuals may be\\nmore likely to stay or leave on the basis of how well they adapt\\nto the group’s language (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. 2013;\\nSrivastava and Goldberg 2017). Quantitative or machine learn-\\ning researchers might capture the most commonly discussed\\ntopics and how these dynamically change over the evolution\\nof the community. Interpretive researchers might examine how\\nthese terms link conceptually, to find underlying community\\nnorms that lead members to stay. Marketing strategy research-\\ners might then use or develop dictionaries to connect these\\ncommunities to firm performance and to offer directions for\\nfirms regarding how to keep members participating across dif-\\nferent brand communities (or contexts).\\nThe progression can flow the other way as well. Outside of a\\nfew early investigations (e.g., Dichter 1966), word of mouth\\nwas originally studied by quantitative researchers interested in\\nwhether interpersonal communication actually drove individ-\\nual and market behavior (e.g., Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006;\\nIyengar, Van den Bulte, and Valente 2011). More recently,\\nhowever, behavioral researchers have begun to study the under-\\nlying drivers of word of mouth, looking at why people talk\\nabout and share some stories, news, and information rather than\\nothers (Berger and Milkman 2012; De Angelis et al. 2012; for a\\nreview, see Berger [2014]). Marketing strategy researchers\\nmight track the text of word-of-mouth interactions to predict\\nthe emergence of brand crises or social media firestorms (e.g.,\\nZhong and Schweidel 2019) as well as when, if, and how to\\nrespond (Herhausen et al. 2019).\\nConsumer–firm interaction is also a rich area to examine.\\nBehavioral researchers could use the data from call centers to\\nbetter understand interpersonal communication between con-\\nsumers and firms and record what drives customer satisfaction\\n(e.g., Packard and Berger 2019a; Packard, Moore, and McFer-\\nran 2018). The back-and-forth between customers and agents\\ncould be used to understand conversational dynamics. More\\nquantitative researchers should use the textual features of call\\ncenters to predict outcomes such as churn and even go beyond\\ntext to examine vocal features such as tone, volume, and speed\\nof speech. Marketing strategy researchers could use calls to\\nunderstand how customer-centric a company is or assess the\\nquality, style, and impact of its sales personnel.\\nFinally, it is worth noting that different tribes not only have\\ndifferent skill sets but also often study substantively different\\ntypes of textual communication. Consumer-to-consumer com-\\nmunication is often studied by researchers in consumer beha-\\nvior, whereas marketing strategy researchers more often tend to\\nstudy firm-to-consumer and firm-to-firm communication. Col-\\nlaboration among researchers from the different subfields may\\nallow them to combine these different sources of textual data.\\n16 Journal of Marketing 84(1) There is ample opportunity to apply theory developed in one\\ndomain to enhance another. Marketing strategy researchers, for\\nexample, often use transaction economics to study business-to-\\nbusiness relationships through agency theory, but these\\napproaches may be equally beneficial when studying\\nconsumer-to-consumer communications.\\nBroadening the Scope of Text Research\\nAs noted in Table 1, certain text flows have been studied more\\nthan others. A large portion of ex i s t i n gw o r kh a sf o c u s e do n\\nconsumers communicating to one another through social\\nmedia and online reviews. The relative availability of such\\ndata has made it a rich area of study and an opportunity to\\napply text analysis to marketing problems.3 Furthermore, for\\nthis area to grow, researchers need to branch out. This\\nincludes expanding (1) data sources, (2) actors examined, and\\n(3) research topics.\\nExpand data sources used.Offline word of mouth, for example,\\ncan be examined to study what people talk about and conversa-\\ntional dynamics. Doctor–patient interactions can be studied to\\nunderstand what drives medical adherence. Text items such as\\nyearbook entries, notes passed between students, or the text of\\nspeed dating conversations can be used to examine relationship\\nformation, maintenance, and dissolution. Using offline data\\nrequires carefully transcribing content, which increases the\\namount of effort required but opens up a range of interesting\\navenues of study. For example, we know very little about the\\ndifferences between online recommendations and face-to-face\\nrecommendations, where the latter also include the interplay\\nbetween verbal and nonverbal information. Moreover, in the\\nnew era of “perpetual contact” our understanding of cross-\\nmessage and cross-channel implications is limited. Research\\nby Batra and Keller (2016) and Villarroel Ordenes et al.\\n(2018) suggests that appropriate sequencing of messages mat-\\nters; it might similarly matter across channels and modality.\\nGiven the rise of technology-enabled realities (e.g., augmented\\nreality, virtual reality, mixed reality), assistive robotics, and\\nsmart speakers, understanding the roles and potential differ-\\nences between language and nonverbal cues could be achieved\\nusing these novel data sources.\\nExpand dyads between text producers and text receivers.There are\\nnumerous dyads relevant to marketing in which text plays a\\ncrucial role. We discuss just a few of the areas that deserve\\nadditional research.\\nConsidering consumer–firm interactions, we expect to see\\nmore research leveraging the rich information exchanged\\nbetween consumers and firms through call centers and chats\\n(e.g., Packard and Berger 2019a; Packard, Moore, and McFer-\\nran 2018). These interactions often reflect inbound\\ncommunication between customers and the firm, which can\\nhave important implications for the relationship between par-\\nties. In addition, how might the language used on packaging or\\nin brand mission statements reflect the nature of organizations\\nand their relationship to their consumers? How might the lan-\\nguage that is most impactful in sales interactions differ from the\\nlanguage that is most useful in customer service interactions?\\nResearch could also probe how the impact of such language\\nvaries across contexts. The characteristics of language used by\\nconsumer packaged goods brands and pharmaceuticals brands\\nin direct-to-consumer advertising likely differ. Similarly, the\\nway in which consumers process the language used in disclo-\\nsures in advertisements for pharmaceuticals (e.g., Narayanan,\\nDesiraju, and Chintagunta 2004) and political candidates (e.g.,\\nWang, Lewis, and Schweidel 2018) may vary.\\nTurning to firm-to-firm interactions, most conceptual\\nframeworks on business-to-business (B2B) exchange relations\\nemphasize the critical role of communication (e.g., Palmatier,\\nDant, and Grewal 2007). Communicational aspects have been\\nlinked to important B2B relational measures such as commit-\\nment, trust, dependence, relationship satisfaction, and relation-\\nship quality. Yet research on actual, word-level B2B\\ncommunication is very limited. For example, very little\\nresearch has examined the types of information exchanged\\nbetween salespeople and customers in offline settings. The\\nability to gather and transcribe data at scale points to important\\nopportunities to do so. As for within-firm communication,\\nresearchers could study informal communications such as\\nmarketing-related emails, memos, and agendas generated by\\nfirms and consumed by their employees.\\nSimilarly, while a great deal of work in accounting and\\nfinance has begun to use annual reports as a data source (for\\na review, see Loughran and McDonald [2016]), marketing\\nresearchers have paid less attention to this area to study com-\\nmunication with investors. Most research has used this data to\\npredict outcomes such as stock performance and other mea-\\nsures of firm valuation. Given recent interest in linking\\nmarketing-related activities to firm valuation (e.g., McCarthy\\nand Fader 2018), this may be an area to pursue further. All firm\\ncommunication, including required documents such as annual\\nreports or discretionary forms of communication such as adver-\\ntising and sales interactions, can be used to measure variables\\nsuch as market orientation, marketing capabilities, marketing\\nleadership styles, and even a firm’s brand personality.\\nThere are also ample research opportunities in the interac-\\ntions between consumers, firms, and society. Data about the\\nbroader cultural and normative environment of firms, such as\\nnews media and government reports, may be useful to shed\\nlight on the forces that shape markets. To understand how a\\ncompany such as Uber navigates resistance to market change,\\nfor example, one might study transcripts of town hall meetings\\nand other government documents in which citizen input is\\nheard and answered. Exogenous shocks in the forms of social\\nmovements such as #metoo and #blacklivesmatter have\\naffected marketing communication and brand image. One\\npotential avenue for future research is to take a cultural\\n3 While readily available data facilitates research, there are downsides to be\\nrecognized, including the representatives of such data and the terms of service\\nthat govern the use of this data.\\nBerger et al. 17 branding approach (Holt 2016) to study how different publics\\ndefine, shape, and advocate for certain meanings in the market-\\nplace. Firms and their brands do not exist in a vacuum, inde-\\npendent of the society in which they operate. Yet limited\\nresearch in marketing has considered how text can be used to\\nderive firms’ intentions and actions at the societal level. For\\nexample, scholars have shown how groups of consumers such\\nas locavores (i.e., people who eat locally grown food; Thomp-\\nson and Coskuner-Balli 2007), fashionistas (Scaraboto and\\nFischer 2012), and bloggers (McQuarrie, Miller, and Phillips\\n2012) shape markets. Through text analysis, the effect of the\\nintentions of these social groups on the market can then be\\nmeasured and better understood.\\nAnother opportunity for future research is the use of textual\\ndata to study culture and cultural success. Topics such as cul-\\ntural propagation, artistic change, and the diffusion of innova-\\ntions have been examined across disciplines with the goal of\\nunderstanding why certain products succeed while others fail\\n(Bass 1969; Boyd and Richerson 1986; Cavalli-Sforza and\\nFeldman 1981; Rogers 1995; Salganik, Dodds, and Watts\\n2006; Simonton 1980). While success may be random (Bielby\\nand Bielby 1994; Hirsch 1972), another possibility is that cul-\\ntural items succeed or fail on the basis of their fit with con-\\nsumers (Berger and Heath 2005). By quantifying aspects of\\nbooks, movies, or other cultural items quickly and at scale,\\nresearchers can measure whether concrete narratives are more\\nengaging, whether more emotionally volatile movies are more\\nsuccessful, whether songs that use certain linguistic features are\\nmore likely to top the Billboard charts, and whether books that\\nevoke particular emotions se ll more copies. While not as\\nwidely available as social media data, more and more data on\\ncultural items has recently become available. Data sets such as\\nthe Google Books corpus (Akpinar and Berger 2015), song\\nlyric websites, or movie script databases provide a wealth of\\ninformation. Such data could enable analyses of narrative\\nstructure to identify “basic plots” (e.g., Reagan et al. 2016; Van\\nLaer et al. 2019).\\nKey Marketing Constructs (That Could Be) Measured\\nwith Text\\nBeginning with previously developed ways of representing\\nmarketing constructs can help some researchers address valid-\\nity concerns. This section details a few of these constructs to\\naid researchers who are beginning to use text analysis in their\\nwork (see the Web Appendix). Using prior operationalization\\nof a construct can ensure concurrent validity—helping build\\nthe literature in a particular domain—but researchers should\\ntake steps to ensure that the prior operationalization has con-\\nstruct validity with their data set.\\nAt the individual level, sentiment and satisfaction are per-\\nhaps some of the most common measurements (e.g., Bu¨schken\\nand Allenby, 2016; Homburg, Ehm, and Artz 2015; Herhausen\\net al. 2019; Ma, Baohung, and Kekre 2015; Schweidel and Moe\\n2014) and have been validated in numerous contexts. Other\\naspects that may be extracted from text include the authenticity\\nand emotionality of language, which have also been explored\\nthrough robust surveys and scales or by combining multiple\\nexisting measurements (e.g., Mogilner, Kamvar, and Aaker\\n2011; Van Laer et al. 2019). There are also psychological con-\\nstructs, such as personality type and construal level (Kern et al.\\n2016; Snefjella and Kuperman 2015), that are potentially use-\\nful for marketing researchers and could also be inferred from\\nthe language used by consumers.\\nFuture work in marketing studying individuals might con-\\nsider measurements of social identification and engagement.\\nThat is, researchers currently have an idea of positive or neg-\\native consumer sentiment, but they are only beginning to\\nexplore emphasis (e.g., Rocklage and Fazio 2015), trust, com-\\nmitment, and other modal properties. To this end, harnessing\\nlinguistic theory of pragmatics and examining phatics over\\nsemantics could be useful (see, e.g., Villarroel et al. 2017).\\nOnce such work is developed, we recommend that researchers\\ncarefully validate approaches proposed to measure such con-\\nstructs along the lines described previously.\\nAt the firm level, constructshave been identified in firm-\\nproduced text such as annual reports and press releases. Mar-\\nket orientation, advertising goals, future orientation, deceitful\\nintentions, firm focus, and innovation orientation have all\\nbeen measured and validated using this material (see Web\\nAppendix Table 1). Work in organizational studies has a his-\\ntory of using text analysis in this area and might provide some\\ninspiration and validation in the study of the existence of\\nmanagerial frames for sensemaking and the effect of activists\\non firm activities.\\nFuture work in marketing at the firm level could further\\nrefine and diversify measurements of strategic orientation\\n(e.g., innovation orientation, market-driving vs. market-\\ndriven orientations). Difficult-to-measure factors deep in the\\norganizational culture, str ucture, or capabilities may be\\nrevealed in the words the firm, its employees, and external\\nstakeholders use to describe it (see Molner, Prabhu, and Yadav\\n[2019]). Likewise, the mindsets and management style of mar-\\nketing leaders may be discerned from the text they use (see\\nYadav, Prabhu, and Chandy [2007]). Firm attributes that are\\nimportant outcomes of firm action (e.g., brand value) could\\nalso be explored using text (e.g., Herhausen et al. 2019). In\\nthis case, there is an opportunity to use new kinds of data. For\\ninstance, internal, employee-based brand value could be mea-\\nsured with text on LinkedIn or Glassdoor. Finally, more subtle\\nattributes of firm language, including conflict, ambiguity, or\\nopenness, might provide some insight into the effects of man-\\nagerial language on firm success. For this, it may be useful to\\nexamine less formal textual data of interactions such as\\nemployee emails, salesperson calls, or customer service cen-\\nter calls.\\nLess work in marketing has measured constructs on the\\nsocial or cultural level, but work in this vein tends to focus\\non how firms fit into the cultural fabric of existing meanings\\nand norms. For instance, institutional logics and legitimacy\\nhave been measured by analyzing media text, as has the rise\\n18 Journal of Marketing 84(1) of brand publics that increase discussion of brands within a\\nculture (Arvidsson and Caliandro 2016).\\nAt the cultural level, marketing research is likely to maintain\\na focus on how firms fit into the cultural environment, but it\\nmay also look to how the cultural environment affects consu-\\nmers. For instance, measurement of cultural uncertainty, risk,\\nhostility, and change could benefit researchers interested in the\\neffects of culture on both consumer and firm effects as well as\\nthe effects of culture and society on government and investor\\nrelationships. Measuring openness and diversity through text\\nare also timely topics to explore and might inspire innovations\\nin measurement, focusing on, for example, language diversity\\nrather than the specific content of language. Important cultural\\ndiscourses such as language around debt and credit could also\\nbe better understood through text analysis. Measurement of\\ngender- and race- related language could be useful in exploring\\ndiversity and inclusion in the way firms and consumers react to\\ntext from a diverse set of writers.\\nOpportunities and Challenges Provided by\\nMethodological Advances\\nOpportunities. As the development of text analysis tools\\nadvances, we expect to see new and improved use of these\\ntools in marketing, which can enable scholars to answer ques-\\ntions we could not previously address or have addressed only in\\na limited manner. Here are a few specific method-driven direc-\\ntions that seem promising.\\nFirst, the vast majority of the approaches used for text anal-\\nysis in marketing (and elsewhere) rely on bag-of-words\\napproaches, and thus, the ability to capture true linguistic rela-\\ntionships among words beyond their cooccurrence was limited.\\nHowever, in marketing we are often interested in capturing the\\nrelationship among entities. For example, what problems or\\nbenefits did the customer mention about a particular feature\\nof a particular product? Such approaches require capturing a\\ndeeper textual relationship among entities than is commonly\\nused in marketing. We expect to see future development in\\nthese areas as deep learning and NLP-based approaches enable\\nresearchers to better capture semantic relationships.\\nSecond, in marketing we are often interested in the latent\\nintention or latent states of writers when creating text, such as\\ntheir emotions, personality, and motivations. Most of the\\nresearch in this area has relied on a limited set of dictionaries\\n(primarily the LIWC dictionary) developed and validated to\\ncapture such constructs. However, these dictionaries are often\\nlimited in capturing nuanced latent states or latent states that\\nmay manifest differently across contexts. Similar to advances\\nmade in areas such as image recognition, with the availability\\nof a large number of human-coded training data (often in the\\nmillions) combined with deep learning tools, we hope to see\\nsimilar approaches being taken in marketing to capture more\\ncomplex behavioral states from text. This would require an\\neffort to human-code a large and diverse set of textual corpora\\nfor a wide range of behavioral states. Transfer learning meth-\\nods commonly used in deep learning tools such as conventional\\nneural nets can then be used to apply the learning from the\\nmore general training data to any specific application.\\nThird, there is also the possibility of using text analysis to\\npersonalize customer–firm interactions. Using machine learn-\\ning, text analysis can also help personalize the customer inter-\\naction by detecting consumer traits (e.g., personality) and states\\n(e.g., urgency, irritation) and perhaps eventually predicting\\ntraits associated with value to the firm (e.g., customer lifetime\\nvalue). After analysis, firms can then tailor customer commu-\\nnication to match linguistic style and perhaps funnel consumers\\nto the appropriate firm representative. The stakes of making\\nsuch predictions may be high, mistakes costly, and there are\\nclearly contexts in which using artificial intelligence impedes\\nconstructing meaningful custom er–firm relationships (e.g.,\\nhealth care; Longoni, Bonezzi, and Morewedge 2019).\\nFourth, while our discussion has focused on textual con-\\ntent, text is just one example of unstructured data, with audio,\\nvideo, and image being others. Social media posts often marry\\ntext with images or videos. Print advertising usually overlays\\ntext on a carefully constructed visual. Although television\\nadvertising may not include text on the screen, it may have\\nan audio track that contains text that progresses simultane-\\no u s l yw i t ht h ev i d e o .\\nUntil recently, text data has received the most attention,\\nmainly due to the presence of tools to extract meaningful fea-\\ntures. That said, tools such as Praat (Boersma 2001) allow\\nresearchers to extract information from audio (e.g., Van Zant\\nand Berger 2019). One of the advantages of audio data over text\\ndata is that it provides richness in the form of tone and voice\\nmarkers that can add to the actual words expressed (e.g., Xiao,\\nKim, and Ding 2013). This enables researchers to study not just\\nwhat was said, but how it was said, examining how pitch, tone,\\nand other vocal or paralinguistic features shape behavior.\\nSimilarly, recent research has developed approaches to ana-\\nlyze images (e.g., Liu, Xuan et al. 2018), either characterizing\\nthe content of the image or identifying features within an\\nimage. Research into the impact of the combination of text and\\nimages is sparse (e.g., Hartmann et al. 2019). For example,\\nimages can be described in terms of their colors. In the context\\nof print advertising, textual content may be less persuasive\\nwhen used in conjunction with images of a particular color\\npalette, whereas other color palettes may enhance the persua-\\nsiveness of text. Used in conjunction with simple images, the\\nimportance of text may be quite pronounced. But, when text is\\npaired with complex imagery, viewers may attend primarily to\\nthe image, diminishing the impact of the text. If this is the case,\\nlegal disclosures that are part of an advertisement’s fine print\\nmay not attract the audience’s attention.\\nAnalogous questions arise as to the role that text plays when\\nincorporated into videos. Research has proposed approaches to\\ncharacterize video content (e.g., Liu et al. 2018). In addition to\\ncomprising the script of the video, text may also appear\\nvisually. In addition to the audio context in which text appears,\\nits impact may depend on the visuals that appear simultane-\\nously. It may also be the case that its position within a video,\\nrelative to the start of the video, may moderate its\\nBerger et al. 19 effectiveness. For example, emotional text content that is spo-\\nken later in a video may be less persuasive for several reasons\\n(e.g., the audience may have ceased paying attention by the\\ntime the text is spoken). Alternatively, the visuals with which\\nthe audio is paired may be more compelling to viewers, or the\\nprevious content of the video may have depleted a viewer’s\\nattentional resources. As our discussion of both images and\\nvideos suggests, text is but one component of marketing com-\\nmunications. Future research must investigate its interplay with\\nother characteristics, including not only the content in which it\\nappears but also when it appears (e.g., Kanuri, Chen, and Srid-\\nhar 2018), and in what media.\\nChallenges. While there are a range of opportunities, textual data\\nalso brings with it various challenges. First is the interpretation\\nchallenge. In some ways, text analysis seems to provide more\\nobjective ways of measuring behavioral processes. Rather than\\nasking people how much they focused on themselves versus\\nothers when sharing word of mouth, for example, one can count\\nthe number of first-person (e.g., “I”) and second-person (e.g.,\\n“you”; Barasch and Berger 2014) pronouns, providing what\\nseems more like ground truth. But while part of this process\\nis certainly more objective (e.g., the number of different types\\nof pronouns), the link between such measures and underlying\\nprocesses (i.e., what it says about the word-of-mouth transmit-\\nter) still requires some degree of interpretation. Other latent\\nmodes of behavior are even more difficult to count. While\\nsome words (e.g., “love”) are generally positive, for example,\\nhow positive they are may depend heavily on idiosyncratic\\nindividual differences as well as the context.\\nMore generally, there is challenge and opportunity in under-\\nstanding the context in which textual information appears.\\nWhile early work in this space, particularly research using\\nentity extraction, asked questions such as how much emotion\\nis in a passage of text, more accurate answers to that question\\ntake must take context into account. A restaurant review may\\ncontain lots of negative words, for example, but does that mean\\nthe person hates the food, the service, or the restaurant more\\ngenerally? Songs that contain more second person-pronouns\\n(e.g., “you”) may be more successful (Packard and Berger\\n2019b), but to understand why, it helps to know whether the\\nlyrics use “you” as the subject or object of the sentence. Con-\\ntext provides meaning, and the more one understands not just\\nwhich words are being used but also how they are being used,\\nthe easier it will be to extract insight. Dictionary-based tools\\nare particularly susceptible to variation in the context in which\\nthe text appears, as dictionaries are often created in a context-\\nfree environment to match multiple contexts. Whenever possi-\\nble, it is advised to use a dictionary that was created for the\\nspecific context of study (e.g., the financial sentiment tool\\ndeveloped by Loughran and McDonald [2016]).\\nAs mentioned previously, there are also numerous metho-\\ndological challenges. Particularly when exploring the “why,”\\nhundreds of features can be extracted, making it important to\\nthink about multiple hypothesis testing (and use of Bonferroni\\nand other corrections). Only the text used by the text creator is\\navailable, so in some sense there is self-selection. Both the\\nindividuals who decide to contribute and the topics people\\ndecide to raise in their writing may suffer from self-selection.\\nParticularly when text is used to measure (complex) behavioral\\nconstructs, validity of the constructs needs to be considered. In\\naddition, for most researchers, analyzing textual information\\nrequires retooling and learning a whole new set of skills.\\nData privacy challenges represent a significant concern.\\nResearch often uses online product reviews and sales ranking\\ndata scraped from websites (e.g., Wang, Mai, and Chiang 2013)\\nor consumers’ social media activity scraped from the platform\\n(e.g., Godes and Mayzlin 2004; Tirunillai and Tellis 2012).\\nAlthough such approaches are common, legal questions have\\nstarted to arise. LinkedIn was unsuccessful in its attempt to\\nblock a startup company from scraping data that was posted\\non users’ public profiles (Rodriguez 2017). While scraping\\npublic data may be permissible under the law, it may conflict\\nwith the terms of service of those platforms that have data of\\ninterest to researchers. For example, Facebook deleted\\naccounts of companies that violated its data-scraping policies\\n(Nicas 2018).4 Such decisions raise important questions about\\nthe extent to which digital platforms can control access to\\ncontent that users have chosen to make publicly available.\\nAs interest in extracting insights from digitized text and\\nother forms of digitized content (e.g., images, videos) grows,\\nresearchers should ensure that they have secured the appropri-\\nate permissions to conduct their work. Failure to do so may\\nresult in it becoming more difficult to conduct such projects.\\nOne potential solution is the creation of an academic data set,\\nsuch as that made available by Yelp (https://www.yelp.com/\\ndataset), which may contain outdated or scrubbed data to\\nensure that it does not pose any risk to the company’s opera-\\ntions or user privacy.\\nThe collection and analysis of digitized text, as well as other\\nuser-created content, also raises questions around users’ expecta-\\ntions for privacy. In the wake of the European Union’s General\\nData Protection Regulation and revelations about Cambridge\\nAnalytica’s ability to collect user data from Facebook, research-\\ners must be mindful of the potential abuses of their work. We\\nshould also consider the extent to which we are overstepping the\\nintended use of user-generated content. For example, while a user\\nmay understand that actions taken on Facebook may result in their\\nbeing targeted with specific advertisements for brands with which\\nthey have interacted, they may not anticipate the totality of their\\nFacebook and Instagram activity being used to construct psycho-\\ngraphic profiles that may be used by other brands. Understanding\\nconsumers’ privacy preferences with regard to their online beha-\\nviors and the text they make available could provide important\\nguidance for practitioners and researchers alike. Another rich area\\nfor future research is the advancement of the precision with which\\nmarketing can be implemented while minimizing intrusions of\\nprivacy (e.g., Provost et al. 2009).\\n4 Facebook’s terms of service with regard to automated data collection can be\\nfound at https://www.facebook.com/apps/site_scraping_tos_terms.php.\\n20 Journal of Marketing 84(1) Concluding Thoughts\\nCommunication is an important facet of marketing that encom-\\npasses communication between organizations and their partners,\\nbetween businesses and their consumers, and among consumers.\\nTextual data holds details of these communications, and through\\nautomated textual analysis, researchers are poised to convert this\\nraw material into valuable insights. Many of the recent advances\\nin the use of textual data were developed in fields outside of\\nmarketing. As we look toward the future and the role of market-\\ners, these recent advancements should serve as exemplars. Mar-\\nketers are well positioned at the interface between consumers,\\nfirms, and organizations to leverage and advance tools to extract\\ntextual information to address some of the key issues faced by\\nbusiness and society today, such as the proliferation of misin-\\nformation, the pervasiveness of technology in our lives, and the\\nrole of marketing in society. Marketing offers an invaluable\\nperspective that is vital to this conversation, but it will only be\\nby taking a broader perspective, breaking theoretical and meth-\\nodological silos, and engaging with other disciplines that our\\nresearch can reach its largest possible audience to affect the\\npublic discourse. We hope this framework encourages a reflec-\\ntion on the boundaries that have come to define marketing and\\nopens avenues for future groundbreaking insights.\\nEditors\\nChristine Moorman and Harald van Heerde\\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\\nFunding\\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\\nship, and/or publication of this article.\\nReferences\\nAkpinar, Ezgi, and Jonah Berger (2015), “Drivers of Cultural Success:\\nT h eC a s eo fS e n s o r yM e t a p h o r s , ”Journal of Personality and\\nSocial Psychology, 109 (1), 20–34.\\nAlessa, Ali, and Miad Faezipour (2018), “A Review of Influenza\\nDetection and Prediction Through Social Networking Sites,”The-\\noretical Biology and Medical Modelling, 15 (1), 1–27.\\nAnderson, Eric T., and Duncan I.

Jonah, thanks for being here. Well, thanks for having me. Now, what was the inspiration for focusing on social influence as the topic of your next book? You know, there's a funny story that I mentioned briefly in the book, but a number of years ago my dad was buying a new car. He lives in DC. He's a lawyer there and he bought a BMW. And then he was complaining that all DC lawyers buy BMWs. I said, well, dad, you bought BMWs. He said, oh, but mine's a blue one. Everyone else drives a gray one. And I think what's really funny about that is social influence happens in the world. Right? We see everybody else doing the same thing. Oh, look at all those DC lawyers. They all drive the same car. But when it comes to our own behavior, sometimes we feel like our own behavior is somehow privileged or different. I'm a rugged individualist. I'm independent. No one else has any effect on what I do. And actually we're kind of wrong. And so what I thought would be interesting to talk about in this book is all the science about how other shape our behavior, often without us knowing it, and what we can do about it and how we can use it to live happier and healthier lives. And now your previous book contagious focused on why things go viral. And I wondered, do you feel like there's an interplay between social influence and virality? I could kind of see how there would be. Oh, certainly. I mean, they're both related to how people shape other people's behavior or decisions. The first book contagious was more about how do we influence others, right? If I'm a business owner or I have an idea I want to spread within my organization, contagious was about, well, we know where it matters. How do I get people to talk about and share my stuff? Invisible influence is a little bit actually almost the converse or the opposite. It's, well, how are other people affecting my behavior? Sure, we can use that to influence others, but we can also use it to make ourselves better off, to help us make better decisions or be healthier when we're having trouble doing that. Now I thought it was interesting in the book that I mean, the book's really not about how to go above the influence because you kind of make the point that resistance is a bit futile when it comes to social influences that whether we know it or not, it's happening. Yeah. And that's I think the most interesting part. We see it all the time. If you ask people to social influence this, of course, my neighbor bought this thing because someone else bought it. My wife did this thing because someone else was doing it, but we don't necessarily see it in ourselves. And I think that idea of resistance as futile is important. I think what we have to be careful of is influence is always a bad thing. Imagine if we couldn't use others as a source of information. If every time we wanted to figure out where to go out to dinner or what movie to watch, we had to sample it ourselves. Exhausting. We'd have to read all the information and look at all the options and sample a little bit here and there. Others are really helpful, cue. Others often help us make better decisions, but not always. And so as invisible influence talks about, you know, when others help us make better decisions, when do they make worse decisions, when do others motivate us, when do they demotivate us, and how can we use this to be better off? Another brings me to my next question. So if we know that social influence is going to play a role, and I think even before I let the book, you know, it plays a little bit, but your book really shows how much of a role it really does play. If we know this, how can we harness that and use it to help us make better decisions? Yeah, so great example. So one thing I talk a little about is motivation. Others often affect whether we give up, whether we try harder. How can we use that to be better off? One thing I felt in my own life, you know, you want to exercise, you want to be healthier. How can you use others to help you do that? Some simple tricks like working out with other people, really having someone else to compare yourself to. There's lots of research on something called social facilitation. Mearily biking with someone else, for example, makes you bike faster. Running with someone else makes you run faster. Swimming with someone else makes you swim faster. Others can help us do things that we might not do otherwise. And so we can set up situations where we actually encourage ourselves to be healthier, encourage ourselves to make better choices by shaping our environment through others. Now, the book really plays into sort of this dichotomy of it either motivates us or demotivates us. Social influence makes us want to do something similar or it makes us want to do something different. What is, I mean, one of the factors that go into determining like how whether social influence, for example, want us, want to make us want to buy the same cars or neighbor versus buy a different one or make us want to work harder versus give up. Yeah. So I have to give you a long answer for all of it. But I think some simple things are, you know, first, others often provide information. So when we're uncertain about what to do, we often look to others and that leads us often to the same thing. Yet at the same time, we want to see ourselves as different, particularly in American culture, we like to see ourselves as special snowflakes. No one else is exactly like my dad buying, you know, the blue BMW rather than the gray one. And so maybe we pick the same car because we know it's a good car because others have bought it, but we pick a different color because colors allow us to feel different. So we're similar and different at the same time. We're optimally distinct or in terms of motivation, for example, you know, others can motivate us, except when they're too much better than we are. And if we compare ourselves to someone who's much better, much faster than we are, sometimes it causes us to give up. You know, we say, well, there's no way I'm going to reach that standard or that score, that level of performance. And so there's so much better than I am that I'm not going to try anymore. And so it's really about understanding the subtle differences of social comparisons and understanding the situations people are in that helps us figure out which way it goes. Now you have a couple really interesting sort of examples like this in this book. So one of my favorite ones I have to say was about why does it make it, why does social influence make it harder for us to parallel park, but easier to tire shoes and the reason is I hate it when people watch me parallel park. I'm horrible at it. If someone's watching, I'm a master if no one is. Yeah. So actually, can I tell you a story and a sort of to get there? So there's this wonderful old study on motivation. And so this research was interesting, just the question you were interested in. He looked at a bunch of research and said, well, sometimes others seem to be motivating least to work harder, do better. Sometimes they lead us to get demotivated, do worse. Why is that? You know, what are situations that lead to one versus the other? And so we wanted to figure out a way to test that. So we designed this amazing experiment with running, actually, looking at how running was affected by other other individuals watching run. But he didn't do it with people. He did it with cockroaches. So we built this like cockroach stadium where these little cockroaches would run cockroach races, you know, run from one stadium side to the other. But then he could manipulate whether other cockroaches watching them. By the way, this is sort of ridiculous thing about cockroaches watching other cockroaches. But he was interested in how does the mere presence of others affect what we do. And he had them run one of two mazes, one that was either straight ahead. You're just really easy or one we had to run straight and then make a left turn really difficult. More sort of requirement out, do I go right? Do I go left? What do I do? And what he found is when the task was easy, when it was well learned running straight, something cockroaches know how to do well, having others around helped them do better. They ran faster with others than they did by themselves. But when it was a difficult task, when they had to sort of figure out, do I go left or do I go right, then it was more complicated. And then the mere presence of others actually made them do worse. And so that's exactly as you mentioned, sort of parallel parking versus other aspects. If we know how to do things well, if they're easy things we've already done a bunch, then having other round makes us do them better. If you're a great shooting pool, for example, shooting pool with someone else, actually make you better at shooting pool than by yourself. But if you're not so good at shooting pool, if it's something that you're not used to doing, if it's difficult for you, then having others around can make you do worse. And so parallel parking, for example, most of us, maybe some of us are good at parallel parking, but most of us tend to be a little bit nervous to begin with. We're not excellent parallel parkers. Clearly having someone else in the car can make it more difficult for us. Makes us more nervous, more anxious. And while that anxiety can help us do better when it's easy for us to do those tasks, they can lead us to do worse when it's a difficult or complicated task. And now you also get back to car buying a little bit. You talk a little bit about in the book how, in fact, people who are more well off, they might be more likely to try to buy a different car than their neighbors, whereas those of us that are maybe more in the middle class, lower class, that we actually, might actually, that social influence might actually cause us to buy the same car. So we tend to think in American culture that it's the uniqueness is the right answer. People who unique and different are good and people who are conformists are bad. Like being a conformist is a negative thing. But it's not a really a right or a wrong answer. It's more of a cultural value. Think about East Asian cultural context, for example, where fitting in being a good member of the group is the right answer. You know, it's not the squeaky real gets the grease. It's the nail that stands out gets hammered down. Even true in American cultural context, in working class context, people like being part of a group, people like being connected to others that are like them. Why would it be bad if you had the same car as your neighbor? It shows that you like the same things that you have a lot in common, whereas in other parts of American culture, we say, oh, you know, standing out is the right thing to do. Why would I want the same thing as everyone else? I want to show that I'm different. And so it's interesting is uniqueness isn't right answer or wrong answer. It's just a way of behaving based on our social environment. Now, I was curious about, now, as the internet has become part of our daily lives all the time, as social media has become more of our daily lives, I feel like it's easier and easier to know what your friends are doing. It's easier for companies to know what even what your friends are doing. How does that play into social influence and maybe the degree to which social influence is playing a role in our decisions? Yeah. What's so interesting about the internet, it's made information spread faster. It's easier as you nicely said to see what others are doing. But that has two kind of differing effects. First, it makes it easier to copy others. So we hear a new band, our friends are listening, we're going to listen to it, makes things catch on much faster than they would have before. Which seems great. If you're that band, it seems fantastic. I've caught on. But it also makes it easier for people to switch to something else or avoid something because too many people are doing it. As I talk about in the book, we don't just want to be similar, we also want to be different. And so sometimes when too many people like a particular band, we say, well, I don't like it anymore. I like their old stuff before they became mainstream. And so what it's really done is it's led to faster cycles of fads and fashion things catch on more quickly, but they also die out just as quickly. And so one thing I talk a lot about for companies and organizations is, well, how do we manage this? As a brand, for example, I want to catch the upswing. I want my product to be everyone to be buying it. But how do we avoid the downswing when people say, well, it's too popular. I don't want it anymore. If those people are doing it, maybe I don't want it. And so how can we capture the good aspects of that and avoid the bad? Now, is it really though? I mean, it seems like it would be so fleeting for companies to catch the upswing. It seems by the time you know there isn't upswing, it's already on the downswing. Yeah, a little bit. I mean, what's also allowed and possible now is there's so much rich behavioral data that we can get more of a sense of who's buying something, what else they've bought and what they're like. And so, Amazon, for example, has a good sense of what type of books we like and can say, well, these type of people used to are, I think, this now a different type of folks are buying it. And so I agree with you. It's not perfect data, but it's certainly better than it's been before. Now, did you, while you were writing this book or researching this book, did you catch yourself at all in terms of like, were you surprised to realize how social influence played into your decisions? Yeah, I am the worst person to shop with or make decisions with. I have a huge problem making decisions. In part of it, because I'm always thinking, well, what are other people doing, right? And I'm saying, well, if they're doing, it's the reason I'm doing it because other people are doing it, or do I really like it myself? And what's interesting is there's no answer to that question. Others often affect us without are realizing it, but by being aware of it, sometimes hopefully we can make better decisions than we would have otherwise. Now, as you were saying, we have this vision, particularly, I think, in an American culture of the rugged individualist. I mean, we place a very high value on non-conformists. I mean, non-conformists are the best. They're pathbreakers. They're above the influence. But what does this book say about, like, I mean, does a non-conformist really exist? And if it does, I mean, this book sort of speaks to like how hard it must be to really be a non-conformist. Yeah. So there's a great cartoon, South Park. You probably aware of it, that has a show where one of the characters says to another, oh, you can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. And what I think is so true about that is even non-conformists are conforming. It's very rare that you find someone that's not influenced by anyone else, even avoiding what others are doing. You're still being influenced. You're just saying, well, I don't want to be like them. Goffs, for example, you look at kids that dress in all black, well, they're all actually pretty similar to one another. And we like to see ourselves as different. We like to think, oh, you know, the unique person, the non-conformist, they went out, they lead companies. Really, those people conform just as much as everybody else. It's just they don't seem like they're conforming because they may not be doing what the mainstream is doing, but they tend to still do what other people like them do. Great.

Oh, thanks for traveling.\", 'source': 'processed_text/The Hidden Forces that Shape Behavior.mp3.txt', 'distance': 1.8501605987548828}, {'text': \" In his new book, Invisible Influence, the Hidden Forces that Shape Behavior, Wharton Marketing Professor Jonah Berger, takes us inside the conscious and unconscious ways that social influences shape our decisions. Jonah, thanks for being here. Well, thanks for having me. Now, what was the inspiration for focusing on social influence as the topic of your next book? You know, there's a funny story that I mentioned briefly in the book, but a number of years ago my dad was buying a new car. He lives in DC. He's a lawyer there and he bought a BMW. And then he was complaining that all DC lawyers buy BMWs. I said, well, dad, you bought BMWs. He said, oh, but mine's a blue one. Everyone else drives a gray one. And I think what's really funny about that is social influence happens in the world. Right? We see everybody else doing the same thing. Oh, look at all those DC lawyers. They all drive the same car. But when it comes to our own behavior, sometimes we feel like our own behavior is somehow privileged or different. I'm a rugged individualist. I'm independent. No one else has any effect on what I do. And actually we're kind of wrong. And so what I thought would be interesting to talk about in this book is all the science about how other shape our behavior, often without us knowing it, and what we can do about it and how we can use it to live happier and healthier lives. And now your previous book contagious focused on why things go viral. And I wondered, do you feel like there's an interplay between social influence and virality? I could kind of see how there would be. Oh, certainly. I mean, they're both related to how people shape other people's behavior or decisions. The first book contagious was more about how do we influence others, right? If I'm a business owner or I have an idea I want to spread within my organization, contagious was about, well, we know where it matters. How do I get people to talk about and share my stuff? Invisible influence is a little bit actually almost the converse or the opposite. It's, well, how are other people affecting my behavior? Sure, we can use that to influence others, but we can also use it to make ourselves better off, to help us make better decisions or be healthier when we're having trouble doing that. Now I thought it was interesting in the book that I mean, the book's really not about how to go above the influence because you kind of make the point that resistance is a bit futile when it comes to social influences that whether we know it or not, it's happening. Yeah. And that's I think the most interesting part. We see it all the time. If you ask people to social influence this, of course, my neighbor bought this thing because someone else bought it. My wife did this thing because someone else was doing it, but we don't necessarily see it in ourselves. And I think that idea of resistance as futile is important. I think what we have to be careful of is influence is always a bad thing. Imagine if we couldn't use others as a source of information. If every time we wanted to figure out where to go out to dinner or what movie to watch, we had to sample it ourselves. Exhausting. We'd have to read all the information and look at all the options and sample a little bit here and there. Others are really helpful, cue. Others often help us make better decisions, but not always. And so as invisible influence talks about, you know, when others help us make better decisions, when do they make worse decisions, when do others motivate us, when do they demotivate us, and how can we use this to be better off? Another brings me to my next question. So if we know that social influence is going to play a role, and I think even before I let the book, you know, it plays a little bit, but your book really shows how much of a role it really does play. If we know this, how can we harness that and use it to help us make better decisions? Yeah, so great example. So one thing I talk a little about is motivation. Others often affect whether we give up, whether we try harder. How can we use that to be better off? One thing I felt in my own life, you know, you want to exercise, you want to be healthier. How can you use others to help you do that? Some simple tricks like working out with other people, really having someone else to compare yourself to. There's lots of research on something called social facilitation. Mearily biking with someone else, for example, makes you bike faster. Running with someone else makes you run faster. Swimming with someone else makes you swim faster. Others can help us do things that we might not do otherwise. And so we can set up situations where we actually encourage ourselves to be healthier, encourage ourselves to make better choices by shaping our environment through others. Now, the book really plays into sort of this dichotomy of it either motivates us or demotivates us. Social influence makes us want to do something similar or it makes us want to do something different. What is, I mean, one of the factors that go into determining like how whether social influence, for example, want us, want to make us want to buy the same cars or neighbor versus buy a different one or make us want to work harder versus give up. Yeah. So I have to give you a long answer for all of it. But I think some simple things are, you know, first, others often provide information. So when we're uncertain about what to do, we often look to others and that leads us often to the same thing. Yet at the same time, we want to see ourselves as different, particularly in American culture, we like to see ourselves as special snowflakes. No one else is exactly like my dad buying, you know, the blue BMW rather than the gray one. And so maybe we pick the same car because we know it's a good car because others have bought it, but we pick a different color because colors allow us to feel different. So we're similar and different at the same time. We're optimally distinct or in terms of motivation, for example, you know, others can motivate us, except when they're too much better than we are. And if we compare ourselves to someone who's much better, much faster than we are, sometimes it causes us to give up. You know, we say, well, there's no way I'm going to reach that standard or that score, that level of performance. And so there's so much better than I am that I'm not going to try anymore. And so it's really about understanding the subtle differences of social comparisons and understanding the situations people are in that helps us figure out which way it goes. Now you have a couple really interesting sort of examples like this in this book. So one of my favorite ones I have to say was about why does it make it, why does social influence make it harder for us to parallel park, but easier to tire shoes and the reason is I hate it when people watch me parallel park. I'm horrible at it. If someone's watching, I'm a master if no one is. Yeah. So actually, can I tell you a story and a sort of to get there? So there's this wonderful old study on motivation. And so this research was interesting, just the question you were interested in. He looked at a bunch of research and said, well, sometimes others seem to be motivating least to work harder, do better. Sometimes they lead us to get demotivated, do worse. Why is that? You know, what are situations that lead to one versus the other? And so we wanted to figure out a way to test that. So we designed this amazing experiment with running, actually, looking at how running was affected by other other individuals watching run. But he didn't do it with people. He did it with cockroaches. So we built this like cockroach stadium where these little cockroaches would run cockroach races, you know, run from one stadium side to the other. But then he could manipulate whether other cockroaches watching them. By the way, this is sort of ridiculous thing about cockroaches watching other cockroaches. But he was interested in how does the mere presence of others affect what we do. And he had them run one of two mazes, one that was either straight ahead. You're just really easy or one we had to run straight and then make a left turn really difficult. More sort of requirement out, do I go right? Do I go left? What do I do? And what he found is when the task was easy, when it was well learned running straight, something cockroaches know how to do well, having others around helped them do better. They ran faster with others than they did by themselves. But when it was a difficult task, when they had to sort of figure out, do I go left or do I go right, then it was more complicated. And then the mere presence of others actually made them do worse. And so that's exactly as you mentioned, sort of parallel parking versus other aspects. If we know how to do things well, if they're easy things we've already done a bunch, then having other round makes us do them better. If you're a great shooting pool, for example, shooting pool with someone else, actually make you better at shooting pool than by yourself. But if you're not so good at shooting pool, if it's something that you're not used to doing, if it's difficult for you, then having others around can make you do worse. And so parallel parking, for example, most of us, maybe some of us are good at parallel parking, but most of us tend to be a little bit nervous to begin with. We're not excellent parallel parkers. Clearly having someone else in the car can make it more difficult for us. Makes us more nervous, more anxious. And while that anxiety can help us do better when it's easy for us to do those tasks, they can lead us to do worse when it's a difficult or complicated task. And now you also get back to car buying a little bit. You talk a little bit about in the book how, in fact, people who are more well off, they might be more likely to try to buy a different car than their neighbors, whereas those of us that are maybe more in the middle class, lower class, that we actually, might actually, that social influence might actually cause us to buy the same car. So we tend to think in American culture that it's the uniqueness is the right answer. People who unique and different are good and people who are conformists are bad. Like being a conformist is a negative thing. But it's not a really a right or a wrong answer. It's more of a cultural value. Think about East Asian cultural context, for example, where fitting in being a good member of the group is the right answer. You know, it's not the squeaky real gets the grease. It's the nail that stands out gets hammered down. Even true in American cultural context, in working class context, people like being part of a group, people like being connected to others that are like them. Why would it be bad if you had the same car as your neighbor? It shows that you like the same things that you have a lot in common, whereas in other parts of American culture, we say, oh, you know, standing out is the right thing to do. Why would I want the same thing as everyone else? I want to show that I'm different. And so it's interesting is uniqueness isn't right answer or wrong answer. It's just a way of behaving based on our social environment. Now, I was curious about, now, as the internet has become part of our daily lives all the time, as social media has become more of our daily lives, I feel like it's easier and easier to know what your friends are doing. It's easier for companies to know what even what your friends are doing. How does that play into social influence and maybe the degree to which social influence is playing a role in our decisions? Yeah. What's so interesting about the internet, it's made information spread faster. It's easier as you nicely said to see what others are doing. But that has two kind of differing effects. First, it makes it easier to copy others. So we hear a new band, our friends are listening, we're going to listen to it, makes things catch on much faster than they would have before. Which seems great. If you're that band, it seems fantastic. I've caught on. But it also makes it easier for people to switch to something else or avoid something because too many people are doing it. As I talk about in the book, we don't just want to be similar, we also want to be different. And so sometimes when too many people like a particular band, we say, well, I don't like it anymore. I like their old stuff before they became mainstream.

I mean, it seems like it would be so fleeting for companies to catch the upswing. It seems by the time you know there isn't upswing, it's already on the downswing. Yeah, a little bit. I mean, what's also allowed and possible now is there's so much rich behavioral data that we can get more of a sense of who's buying something, what else they've bought and what they're like. And so, Amazon, for example, has a good sense of what type of books we like and can say, well, these type of people used to are, I think, this now a different type of folks are buying it.

Moe,\\nOded Netzer, and David A. Schweidel\\nAbstract\\nWords are part of almost every marketplace interaction. Online reviews, customer service calls, press releases, marketing com-\\nmunications, and other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can marketers best use such data? This article provides an\\noverview of automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate marketing insights. The authors discuss how text\\nreflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient.\\nNext, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview\\nmethodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some\\ncommon metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a\\ndiscussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing.\\nWhile most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the\\nsubareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.\\nKeywords\\ncomputational linguistics, machine learning, marketing insight, interdisciplinary, natural language processing, text analysis, text mining\\nOnline supplement: https://doi.org/10.1177/0022242919873106\\nThe digitization of information has made a wealth of textual\\ndata readily available. Consumers write online reviews, answer\\nopen-ended survey questions, and call customer service repre-\\nsentatives (the content of which can be transcribed). Firms\\nwrite ads, email frequently, publish annual reports, and issue\\npress releases. Newspapers c ontain articles, movies have\\nscripts, and songs have lyrics. By some estimates, 80%–95%\\nof all business data is unstructured, and most of that unstruc-\\ntured data is text (Gandomi and Haider 2015).\\nSuch data has the potential to shed light on consumer, firm,\\nand market behavior, as well as society more generally. But, by\\nitself, all this data is just that—data. For data to be useful,\\nresearchers must be able to extract underlying insight—to mea-\\nsure, track, understand, and interpret the causes and conse-\\nquences of marketplace behavior.\\nThis is where the value of automated textual analysis comes\\nin. Automated textual analysis 1 is a computer-assisted\\nmethodology that allows researchers to rid themselves of mea-\\nsurement straitjackets, such as scales and scripted questions,\\nand to quantify the information contained in textual data as it\\nnaturally occurs. Given these benefits, the question is no longer\\nwhether to use automated text analysis buthow these tools can\\nbest be used to answer a range of interesting questions.\\nThis article provides an overview of the use of automated\\ntext analysis for marketing insight.

First, we illustrate how text data can be used for\\nboth prediction and understanding, to gain insight into who\\nproduced that text, as well as how that text may impact the\\npeople and organizations that consume it. Second, we provide a\\nhow-to guide for those new to text analysis, detailing the main\\ntools, pitfalls, and challenges that researchers may encounter.\\nThird, we offer a set of expansive research propositions per-\\ntaining to using text as a means to understand meaning making\\nin markets with a focus on how customers, firms, and societies\\nconstrue or comprehend marketplace interactions, relation-\\nships, and themselves. Whereas previous treatments of text\\nanalysis have looked specifically at consumer text (Humphreys\\nand Wang 2017), social media communication (Kern et al.\\n2016), or psychological processes (Tausczik and Pennebaker\\n2010), we aim to provide a framework for incorporating text\\ninto marketing research at the individual, firm, market, and\\nsocietal levels. By necessity, our approach includes a wide-\\nranging set of textual data sources (e.g., user-generated content,\\nannual reports, cultural artifacts, government text).\\nFourth, and most importantly, we discuss how text analysis can\\nhelp “unite the tribes.” As a field, part of marketing’s value is its\\ninterdisciplinary nature. Unlike core disciplines such as psychol-\\nogy, sociology, or economics, the marketing discipline is a big\\ntent that allows researchers from different traditions and research\\nphilosophies (e.g., quantitative modeling, consumer behavior,\\nstrategy, consumer culture theory) to come together to study\\nrelated questions (Moorman et al. 2019a, b). In reality, however,\\nthe field often seems fragmented. Rather than different rowers all\\nsimultaneously pulling together, it often feels more like separate\\ntribes, each independently going off in separate directions.\\nAlthough everyone is theoretically working toward similar goals,\\nthere tends to be more communication within groups than\\nbetween them. Different gr oups often speak different\\n“languages” (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, statis-\\ntics, economics, organizational behavior) and use different tools,\\nmaking it increasingly difficult to have a common conversation.\\nHowever, text analysis can unite the tribes. Not only does it\\ninvolve skills and ideas from each of these areas, doing it well\\nrequires such integration because it borrows ideas, concepts,\\napproaches, and methods from each tribe and incorporates them\\nto achieve insight. In so doing, the approach also adds value to\\neach of the tribes in ways that might not otherwise be possible.\\nWe start by discussing two distinctions that are useful when\\nthinking about how text can be used: (1) whether text reflects or\\nimpacts (i.e., says something about the producer or has a down-\\nstream impact on something else) and (2) whether text is used\\nfor prediction or understanding (i.e., predicting something or\\nunderstanding what caused something). Next, we explain how\\ntext may be used to unite the tribes of marketing. Then we\\nprovide an overview of text analysis tools and methodology\\nand discuss key questions and measures of validity. Finally,\\nwe close with a future research agenda.\\nThe Universe of Text\\nCommunication is an integral part of marketing. Not only do\\nfirms communicate with customers, but customers communi-\\ncate with firms and one another. Moreover, firms communicate\\nwith investors and society communicates ideas and values to\\nthe public (through newspapers and movies). These communi-\\ncations generate text or can be transcribed into text.\\nA simple way to organize the world of textual data is to\\nthink about producers and receivers—the person or organi-\\nzation that creates the text and the person or organization\\nwho consumes the text (Table 1). While there are certainly\\nother parties that could be listed, some of the main\\nproducers and receivers are consumers, firms, investors, and\\nsociety at large. Consumers write online reviews that are\\nread by other consumers, firms create annual reports that\\nare read by investors, and cultural producers represent soci-\\netal meanings through the creation of books, movies, and\\nother digital or physical artifacts that are consumed by indi-\\nviduals or organizations.\\nConsistent with this distinction between text producer and\\ntext receiver, researchers may choose to study how text reflects\\nor impacts. Specifically, text reflects information about, and\\nthus can be used to gain insight into, the textproducer or one\\ncan study how text impacts the textreceiver.\\nText as a Reflection of the Producer\\nText reflects and indicates something about the text producer\\n(i.e., the person, organization, or context that created it). Cus-\\ntomers, firms, and organizations use language to express them-\\nselves or achieve desired goals, and as a result, text signals\\ninformation about the actors, organization, or society that cre-\\nated it and the contexts in which it was created. Like an anthro-\\npologist piecing together pottery shards to learn about a distant\\ncivilization, text provides a window into its producers.\\nTake, for example, a social media post in which someone\\ntalks about what they did that weekend. The text that person\\nproduces provides insight into several facets. First, it provides\\ninsight into the individual themselves. Are they introverted or\\nextraverted? Neurotic or conscientious? It sheds light on who\\nthey are in general (i.e., stable traits or customer segments;\\nMoon and Kamakura 2017) as well as how they may be feeling\\nor what they may be thinking at the moment (i.e., states). In a\\nsense, language can be viewed as a fingerprint or signature\\n(Pennebaker 2011). Just like brush strokes or painting style can\\nbe used to determine who painted a particular painting,\\nresearchers use words and linguistic style to infer whether a\\nplay was written by Shakespeare, or if a person is depressed\\n(Rude, Gortner, and Pennebaker 2004) or being deceitful\\n2 Journal of Marketing 84(1) (Ludwig et al. 2016). The same is true for groups, organiza-\\ntions, or institutions. Language reflects something about who\\nthey are and thus provides insight into what they might do in\\nthe future.\\nSecond, text can provide insight into a person’s attitudes\\ntoward or relationships with other attitude objects—whether\\nthat person liked a movie or hated a hotel stay, for example,\\nor whether they are friends or enemies with someone.

For example, the words a leader uses reflect who\\nthey are as an individual, their leadership style, and their\\nattitudes toward various stakeholders. The language used in\\nads, on websites, or by customer service agents reflects infor-\\nmation about the company those pieces of text represent.\\nAspects such as brand personality (Opoku, Abratt, and Pitt\\n2006), how much a firm is thinking about its customers (Pack-\\nard and Berger 2019a), or managers’ orientation toward end\\nusers (Molner, Prabhu, and Yadav 2019) can be understood\\nthrough text. Annual reports provide insight into how well a\\nfirm is likely to perform in the future (Loughran and McDo-\\nnald 2016).\\nYet beyond single individuals or organizations, text can also\\nbe aggregated across creators to study larger social groups or\\ninstitutions. Given that texts reflect information about the peo-\\nple or organizations that created them, grouping people or\\norganizations together on the basis of shared characteristics\\ncan provide insight into the nature of such groups and differ-\\nences between them. Analyzing blog posts, for example, can\\nshed light on how older and younger people view happiness\\ndifferently (e.g., as excitement vs. peacefulness; Mogilner,\\nKamvar, and Aaker 2011). In a comparison of newspaper arti-\\ncles and press releases about different business sectors, text can\\nbe used to understand the creation and spread of globalization\\ndiscourse (Fiss and Hirsch 2005). Customers’ language use\\nfurther gives insight into the consumer sentiment in online\\nbrand communities (Homburg, Ehm, and Artz 2015).\\nMore broadly, because texts are shaped by the contexts (e.g.,\\ndevices, cultures, time periods) in which they were produced,\\nthey also reflect information about these contexts. In the case of\\nculture, U.S. culture values high-arousal positive affective\\nstates more than East Asian cultures (Tsai 2007), and these\\ndifferences may show up in the language these different groups\\nuse. Similarly, whereas members of individualist cultures tend\\nto use first-person pronouns (e.g., “I”), members of collectivist\\ncultures tend to use a greater proportion of third-person pro-\\nnouns (e.g., “we”).\\nAcross time, researchers were able to examine whether the\\nnational mood changed after the September 11 attacks by\\nstudying linguistic markers of psychological change in online\\ndiaries (Cohn, Mehl, and Pennebaker 2004). The language\\nused in news articles, songs, and public discourse reflects\\nsocietal attitudes and norms, and thus analyzing changes over\\ntime can provide insight into aspects such as attitudes toward\\nwomen and minorities (Boghrati and Berger 2019; Garg et al.\\n2018) or certain industries (Humphreys 2010). Journal articles\\nprovide a window into the evolution of topics within acade-\\nmia (Hill and Carley 1999). Books and movies serve as sim-\\nilar cultural barometers and could be used to shed light on\\neverything from cultural differences in customs to changes in\\nvalues over time.\\nConsequently, text analysis can provide insights that may\\nnot be easily (or cost-effectively) obtainable through other\\nmethods. Companies and organizations can use social listening\\n(e.g., online reviews and blog posts) to understand whether\\nconsumers like a new product, how customers feel about their\\nbrand, what attributes are relevant for decision making, or what\\nother brands fall in the same consideration set (Lee and Bra-\\ndlow 2011; Netzer et al. 2012). Regulatory agencies can deter-\\nmine adverse reactions to pharmaceutical drugs (Feldman et al.\\n2015; Netzer et al. 2012), public health officials can gauge how\\nbad the flu will be this year and where it will hit the hardest\\n(Alessa and Faezipour 2018), and investors can try to predict\\nthe performance of the stock market (Bollen, Mao, and Zeng\\n2011; Tirunillai and Tellis 2012).\\nText’s Impact on Receivers\\nIn addition to reflecting information about the people, organi-\\nzations, or society that created it, text also impacts or shapes the\\nattitudes, behavior, and choices of the audience that consumes\\nit. For example, take the language used by a customer service\\nagent. While that language certainly reflects something about\\nthat agent (e.g., their personality, how they are feeling that\\nday), how they feel toward the customer, and what type of\\nbrand they represent, that language also impacts the customer\\nwho receives it (Packard and Berger 2019a; Packard, Moore,\\nand McFerran 2018). It can change customer attitudes toward\\nthe brand, influence future purchase, or affect whether custom-\\ners talk about the interaction with their friends. In that sense,\\nlanguage has a meaningful and measurable impact on the\\nworld. It has consequences.\\nThis can be seen in a myriad of different contexts. Ad copy\\nshapes customers’ purchase behavior (Stewart and Furse\\n1986), newspaper language c hanges customers’ attitudes\\n(Humphreys and LaTour 2013), trade publications and con-\\nsumer magazines shift product category perceptions (e.g.,\\nRosa et al. 1999), movie scripts shape audience reactions\\n(Berger, Kim, and Meyer 2019; Eliashberg, Hui, and Zhang\\n2014; Reagan et al. 2016), and song lyrics shape song market\\nsuccess (Berger and Packard 2018; Packard and Berger\\n2019b). The language used inpolitical debates shapes which\\ntopics get attention (Berman et al. 2019), the language used in\\nconversation shapes interpersonal attitudes (Huang et al.\\n2017), and the language used in news articles shapes whether\\npeople read (Berger, Moe, and Schweidel, 2019b) or share\\n(Berger and Milkman 2012) them.\\nFirms’ language choice has impact as well. For example,\\nnuances in language choices by firms when responding to cus-\\ntomer criticism online directly impacts consumers and, thus,\\nthe firms’ success in containing social media firestorms (Her-\\nhausen et al. 2019). Language used in YouTube ads is corre-\\nlated with their virality (Tellis et al. 2019). Shareholder\\ncomplaints about nonfinancial concerns and topics that receive\\nhigh media attention substantially increase firms’ advertising\\ninvestments (Wies et al. 2019).\\n4 Journal of Marketing 84(1) Note that while the distinction between text reflecting and\\nimpacting is a useful one, it is not an either/or. Text almost\\nalways simultaneously reflects and impacts. Text always\\nreflects information about the actor or actors that created it,\\nand as long as some audience consumes that text, it also\\nimpacts that audience.\\nDespite this relationship, researchers studying reflection\\nversus impact tend to use text differently. Research that exam-\\nines what the text reflects often treats it as a dependent variable\\nand investigates how it relates to the text creator’s personality,\\nthe social groups they belong to, or the time period or culture in\\nwhich it was created.\\nResearch that examines how text impacts others often treats\\nit as an independent variable, examining if and how text shapes\\noutcomes such as purchase, sharing, or engagement. In this\\nframework, textual elements are linked with outcomes that are\\nbelieved to be theoretical consequences of the textual compo-\\nnents or some latent variable that they are thought to represent.\\nContextual Influences on Text\\nImportantly, text is also shaped by contextual factors; thus, to\\nbetter understand its meaning and impact, it is important to\\nunderstand the broader situation in which it was produced.\\nContext can affect content in three ways: through technical\\nconstraints and social norms of the genre, through shared\\nknowledge specific to the speaker and receiver, and through\\nprior history.\\nFirst, different types of texts are influenced by formal and\\ninformal rules and norms that shape the content and expecta-\\ntions about the message. For example, newspaper genres such\\nas opinion pieces or feature stories will contain a less\\n“objective” point of view than traditional reporting (Ljung\\n2000). Hotel comment cards and other feedback are usually\\ndominated by more extreme opinions. On Snapchat and other\\nsocial media platforms, messages are relatively recent, short,\\nand often ephemeral. In contrast, online reviews can be longer\\nand are often archived dating back several years. Synchronic\\ntext exchanges, in which two individuals interactively commu-\\nnicate in real time may be more informal and contain dialogue\\nof short statements and phatic responses (i.e., communication\\nsuch as “Hi,” which serves a social function) that indicate\\naffiliation rather than semantic content (Kulkarni 2014). Some\\ngenres (e.g., social media) are explicitly public, whereas on\\nothers, such as blogs, information that is more private may\\nbe conveyed.\\nText is also shaped by technological constraints (e.g., the\\nability to like or share) and physical constraints (e.g., charac-\\nter length limitations). Tweets, for example, necessarily have\\n280 characters or fewer, which may shape the ways in which\\nthey are used to communicate. Mobile phones have con-\\nstraints on typing and may shape the text that people produce\\non them (Melumad, Inman, and Pham 2019; Ransbotham,\\nLurie, and Liu 2019).\\nSecond, the relationship between the text producer and con-\\nsumer may affect what is said (or, more often, unsaid). If the\\nproducer and consumer know each other well, text may be\\nrelatively informal (Goffman 1959) and lack explicit informa-\\ntion that a third party would need to make sense of the con-\\nversation (e.g., past events, known likes/dislikes). If both have\\nan understanding of the goal of the communication (e.g., that\\nthe speaker wants to persuade the receiver), this may shape the\\ncontent but be less explicit.\\nThese factors are important tounderstand when interpret-\\ning the content of the text itself. Content has been shown to\\nbe shaped by the creator’s intended audience (Vosoughi,\\nRoy, and Aral 2018) and anticipated effects on the receiver\\n(Barasch and Berger 2014). Similarly, what consumers share\\nwith their best friend may be different (e.g., less impacted\\nby self-presentational motiv ations) than what they post\\nonline for everyone to see.2 Firms’ annual reports may be\\nshaped by the goals of appearing favorably to the market.\\nWhat people say on a customer service call may be driven\\nby the goal of getting monetary compensation. Consumer\\nprotests online are meant to inspire change, not merely\\ninform others.\\nFinally, history may affect the content of the text. In mes-\\nsage boards, prior posts may shape future posts; if someone\\nraised a point in a previous post, the respondent will most likely\\nrefer to the point in future posts. If retweets are included in an\\nanalysis, this will bias content toward most circulated posts.\\nMore broadly, media frames such as #metoo or #blacklives-\\nmatter might make some concepts or facts more accessible to\\nspeakers and therefore more likely to emerge in text, even if\\nseemingly unrelated (McCombs and Shaw 1972; Xiong, Cho,\\nand Boatwright 2019).\\nUsing Text for Prediction Versus\\nUnderstanding\\nBeyond reflecting information about the text creator and\\nshaping outcomes for the text recipient, another useful dis-\\ntinction is whether text is used for prediction or\\nunderstanding.\\nPrediction\\nSome text research is predominantly interested in prediction.\\nWhich customer is most likely to default on their loan (Netzer,\\nLemaire, and Herzenstein 2019)? Which movie will sell the\\nmost tickets (Eliashberg et al. 2014)? How will the stock mar-\\nket perform (Bollen, Mao, and Zeng 2011; Tirunillai and Tellis\\n2012)? Whether focusing on individual-, firm-, or market-level\\noutcomes, the goal is to predict with the highest degree of\\naccuracy. Such work often takes many textual features and uses\\nmachine learning or other methods to combine these features in\\na way that achieves the best prediction. The authors care less\\n2 Note that intermediaries can amplify (e.g., retweet) an original message and\\nmay have different motivations than the text producer.\\nBerger et al. 5 about any individual feature and more about how the set of\\nobservable features can be combined to predict an outcome.\\nThe main difficulty involved with using text for predictions\\nis that text can generate hundreds and often thousands of fea-\\ntures (words) that are all potential predictors for the outcome of\\ninterest. In some cases, the number of predictors is larger than\\nthe number of observations, making traditional statistical pre-\\ndictive models largely impractical. To address this issue,\\nresearchers often resort to machine learning–type methods, but\\noverfitting needs to be carefully considered. In addition, infer-\\nence with respect to the role of each word in the prediction can\\nbe difficult. Methods such as feature importance weighing can\\nhelp extract some inference from these predictive models.\\nUnderstanding\\nOther research is predominantly interested in using text for\\nunderstanding. How does the language consumers use shape\\nword of mouth’s impact (Packard and Berger 2017)? Why do\\nsome online posts get shared, songs become popular, or\\nbrands engender greater loyalty? How do cultural attitudes\\nor business practices change? Whether focusing on\\nindividual-, firm-, or market-level outcomes, the goal is to\\nunderstand why or how something occurred. Such work often\\ninvolves examining only one or a small number of textual\\nfeatures or aspects that link to underlying psychological or\\nsociological processes and aims to understand which features\\nare driving outcomes and why.\\nOne challenge with using textual data for understanding\\nis drawing causal inferences from observational data. Con-\\nsequently, work in this area may augment field data with\\nexperiments to allow key independent variables to be\\nmanipulated. Another challenge is interpreting relationships\\nwith textual features (we discuss this further in the closing\\nsection). Songs that use more second-person pronouns are\\nmore popular (Packard and Berger 2019b), for example, but\\nthis relationship alone doesnot necessarily explain why this\\nis the case; second-person pronouns may indicate several\\nthings. Consequently, deeper t heorizing, examination of\\nlinks observed in prior research, or further empirical work\\nis often needed.\\nNote that research that can use either a prediction or\\nunderstanding lens to study either what text reflects or what\\nit impacts. On the prediction side, researchers interested in\\nwhat text reflects could use it to predict states or traits of\\nthe text creator such as customer satisfaction, likelihood of\\nchurn, or brand personality. Researchers interested in the\\nimpact of text could predict how text will shape outcomes\\nsuch as reading behavior, sharing, or purchase among con-\\nsumers of that text.\\nOn the understanding side, someone interested in what text\\nreflects could use it to shedlight on why people might use\\ncertain personal pronouns when they are depressed or why\\ncustomers might use certain types of emotional language\\nwhen they are talking to customer service. Someone inter-\\nested in the impact of text could use it to understand why text\\nthat evokes different emotions might be more likely to be read\\nor shared.\\nFurthermore, while most research tends to focus on either\\nprediction or understanding, some work integrates both\\naspects. Netzer, Lemaire, and Herzenstein (2019), for example,\\nboth use a range of available textual features to predict whether\\na given person will default on a loan and analyze the specific\\nlanguage used by people who tend to default (e.g., language\\nused by liars).\\nUniting the Tribes of Marketing\\nRegardless of whether the focus is on text reflection versus\\nimpact, or prediction versus understanding, doing text analysis\\nwell requires integrating skills, techniques, and substantive\\nknowledge from different areas of marketing. Furthermore,\\ntextual analysis opens up a wealth of opportunity for each of\\nthese areas as well.\\nTake consumer behavior. While hypothetical scenarios can\\nbe useful, behavioral economics has recently gotten credit for\\nmany applications of social or cognitive psychology because\\nthese researchers have demonstrated phenomena in the field.\\nGiven concerns about replication, researchers have started to\\nlook for new tools that enable them to ensure validity and\\nincrease relevance to external audiences. Previously, use of\\nsecondary data was often limited because it addressed the\\n“what” but not the “why” (i.e., what people bought or did, but\\nnot why they did so). But text can provide a window into the\\nunderlying process. Online reviews, for example, can be used\\nto understand why someone bought one thing rather than\\nanother. Blog posts can help marketers understand consider-\\nation sets (Lee and Bradlow 2011; Netzer et al. 2012) and the\\ncustomer journey (Li and Du 2011). Text even helps address\\nthe age-old issue of telling more than we can know (Nisbett and\\nWilson 1977). While people may not always know why they\\ndid something, their language often provides traces of explana-\\ntion (Pennebaker 2011), even beyond what they can con-\\nsciously articulate.\\nThis richness is attractive to more than just behavioral\\nresearchers. Text opens a large-scale window into the world\\nof “why” in the field and does so in a scalable manner. Quan-\\ntitative modelers are always looking for new data sources and\\ntools to explain and predict behavior. Unstructured data pro-\\nvides a rich set of predictors that are often readily available, at\\nlarge scale, and able to be combined with structured measures\\nas either dependent variables or independent variables. Text,\\nthrough product reviews, user-driven social media activity, and\\nfirm-driven marketing efforts, provides data in real time that\\ncan shed light on consumer needs/preferences. This offers an\\nalternative or supplement to traditional marketing research\\ntools. In many cases, text can be retraced to an individual,\\nallowing distinction between individual differences and\\ndynamics. It also offers a playground where new methodolo-\\ngies from other disciplines can be applied (e.g., deep learning;\\nLeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015; Liu et al. 2019).\\n6 Journal of Marketing 84(1) Marketing strategy researchers want logic by which business\\ncan achieve its marketing objectives and to better understand\\nwhat affects organizational success. A primary challenge to\\nthese researchers is to obtain reliable and generalizable survey\\nor field data about factors that lie deep in the firm’s culture and\\nstructure or that are housed in the mental models and beliefs of\\nmarketing leaders and employees. Text analysis offers an objec-\\ntive and systematic solution to assess constructs in naturally\\noccurring data (e.g., letters to shareholders, press releases, patent\\ntext, marketing messages, conference calls with analysts) that\\nmay be more valid. Likewise, marketing strategy scholars often\\nstruggle with valid measures of a firm’s marketing assets, and\\ntext may be a useful tool to understand the nature of customer,\\npartner, and employee relationships and the strength of brand\\nsentiments. For example, Ku¨bler, Colicev, and Pauwels (2017)\\nuse dictionaries and support vector machine methods to extract\\nsentiment and relate it to consumer mindset metrics.\\nScholars who draw from anthropology and sociology have\\nlong examined text through qualitative interpretation and con-\\ntent analysis. Consumer cultu re theory–oriented marketing\\nresearchers are primarily interested in understanding underly-\\ning meanings, norms, and values of consumers, firms, and\\nmarkets in the marketplace. Text analysis provides a tool for\\nquantifying qualitative information to measure changes over\\ntime or make comparisons between groups. Sociological and\\nanthropological researchers can use automated text analysis to\\nidentify important words, locate themes, link them to text seg-\\nments, and examine common expressions in their context. For\\nexample, to understand consumer taste practices, Arsel and\\nBean (2013) use text analysis to first identify how consumers\\ntalk about different taste objects, doings, and meanings in their\\ntextual data set (comments on a website/blog) before analyzing\\nthe relationship between these elements using interview data.\\nFor marketing practitioners, textual analysis unlocks the\\nvalue of unstructured data and offers a hybrid between quali-\\ntative and quantitative marketing research. Like qualitative\\nresearch, it is rich, exploratory, and can answer the “why,” but\\nlike quantitative research, it benefits from scalability, which\\noften permits modeling and statistical testing. Textual analysis\\nenables researchers to explore open-ended questions for which\\nthey do not know the range of possible answers a priori. With\\ntext, scholars can answer questions that they did not ask or for\\nwhich they did not know the right outcome measure. Rather\\nthan forcing on participants a certain scale or set of outcomes\\nfrom which to select, for example, marketing researchers can\\ninstead ask participants broad questions, such as why they like\\nor dislike something, and then use topic modeling tools such as\\nlatent Dirichlet allocation (LDA; explained in detail subse-\\nquently) to discover the key underlying themes.\\nImportantly, while text analysis offers opportunities for a\\nvariety of research tradition s, such opportunities are more\\nlikely to be realized when researchers work across traditional\\nsubgroups. That is, the benefits of computer-aided text analysis\\nare best realized if we include both quantitative, positivist\\nanalyses of content and qualitative, interpretive analyses of\\ndiscourse. Quantitative researchers, for example, have the\\nskills to build the right statistical models, but they can benefit\\nfrom behavioral and qualitative researchers’ ability to link\\nwords to underlying psychological or social processes as well\\nas marketing strategy researchers’ understanding of organiza-\\ntional and marketing activities driving firm performance. This\\nis true across all of the groups.\\nThus, to really extract insights from textual data, research\\nteams must have the interpretative skills to understand the\\nmeaning of words, the behavioral skills to link them to under-\\nlying psychological processes, the quantitative skills to build\\nthe right statistical models, and the strategy skills to understand\\nwhat these findings mean for firm actions and outcomes. We\\noutline some potential areas fo r fruitful collaboration in\\n“Future Research Agenda” section.\\nText Analysis Tools, Methods, and Metrics\\nGiven the recent work using text analysis to derive marketing\\ninsight, some researchers may wonder where to start. This\\nsection reviews methodologies often used in text-based\\nresearch. These include techniques needed to convert text into\\nconstructs in the research process as well as procedures needed\\nto incorporate extracted textual information into subsequent\\nmodeling and analyses. The objective of this section is not to\\nprovide a comprehensive tutorial but, rather, to expose the\\nreader to available techniques, discuss when different methods\\nare appropriate, and highlight some of the key considerations in\\napplying each method.\\nThe process of text analysis involves several steps: (1) data\\npreprocessing, (2) performing atext analysis of the resulting\\ndata, (3) converting the text into quantifiable measures, and\\n(4) assessing the validity of the extracted text and measures.\\nEach of these steps may vary depending on the research objec-\\ntive. Table 2 provides a summary of the different steps\\ninvolved in the text analysis process from preprocessing to com-\\nmonly used tools and measures and validation approaches. Table\\n2 can serve as a starter kit for those taking their first steps with\\ntext analysis.\\nData Preprocessing\\nText is often unstructured and “messy,” so before any formal\\nanalyses can take place, researchers must first preprocess the\\ntext itself. This step provides structure and consistency so that\\nthe text can be used systematically in the scientific process.\\nCommon software tools for text analysis include Python (https://\\nwww.nltk.org/) and R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/\\nquanteda/quanteda.pdf, https://quanteda.io/). For both software\\nplatforms, a set of relatively easy-to-use tools has been devel-\\noped to perform most of the data preprocessing steps. Some\\nprograms, such as Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC;\\nTausczik and Pennebaker 2010) and WordStat (Peladeau 2016),\\nrequire minimal preprocessing. We detail the data preprocessing\\nsteps next (for a summary of the steps, see Table 3).\\nBerger et al. 7 Data acquisition. Data acquisition can be well defined if the\\nresearcher is provided with a set of documents (e.g., emails,\\nquarterly reports, a data set of product reviews) or more open-\\nended if the researcher is using a web scraper (e.g., Beautiful\\nSoup) that searches the web for instances of a particular topic\\nor a specific product. When scraping text from public sources,\\nresearchers should abide by the legal guidelines for using the\\ndata for academic or commercial purposes.\\nTokenization. Tokenization is the process of breaking the text into\\nunits (often words and sentences). When tokenizing, the\\nresearcher needs to determine the delimiters that define a token\\n(space, period, semicolon, etc.). If, for example, a space or a period\\nis used to determine a word, it may produce some nonsensical\\ntokens. For example, “the U.S.” may be broken to the tokens “the,”\\n“U,” and “S.” Most text-mining software has smart tokenization\\nprocedures to alleviate such common problems, but the\\nresearcher should pay close atten t i o nt oi n s t a n c e st h a ta r es p e -\\ncific to the textual corpora. For cases that include paragraphs or\\nthreads, depending on the research objective, the researcher\\nmay wish to tokenize these larger units of text as well.\\nCleaning. HTML tags and nontextual information, such as\\nimages, are cleaned or removed from the data set. The cleaning\\nneeds may depend on the format in which the data was provided/\\nextracted. Data extracted from the web often requires heavier\\ncleaning due to the presence of HTML tags. Depending on the\\npurpose of the analysis, images and other nontextual information\\nmay be retained. Contractions such as “isn’t” and “can’t” need to\\nbe expanded at this step. In this step, researchers should also be\\nmindful of and remove phrases automatically generated by com-\\nputers that may occur within the text (e.g., “html”).\\nRemoving stop words.Stop words are common words such as “a”\\nand “the” that appear in most documents but often provide no\\nsignificant meaning. Common text-mining tools (e.g., the tm,\\nquanteda, tidytext, and tokenizers package in R; the Natural\\nLanguage Toolkit package in Python; exclusion words in\\nWordStat) have a predefined list of such stop words that can\\nbe amended by the researcher. It is advisable to add common\\nwords that are specific to the domain (e.g., “Amazon” in a\\ncorpora of Amazon reviews) to this list. Depending on the\\nresearch objective, stop words can sometimes be very mean-\\ningful, and researchers may wish to retain them for their anal-\\nysis. For example, if the researcher is interested in extracting\\nnot only the content of the text but also writing style (e.g.,\\nPackard, Moore, and McFerran 2018), stop words can be very\\ninformative (Pennebaker 2011).\\nSpelling. Most text-mining packages have prepackaged spellers\\nthat can help correct spelling mistakes (e.g., the Enchant spel-\\nler). In using these spellers, the researcher should be aware of\\nlanguage that is specific to the domain and may not appear in\\nthe speller—or even worse, that the speller may incorrectly\\n“fix.” Moreover, for some analyses the researcher may want\\nto record the number of spelling mistakes as an additional\\nTable 2.The Text Analysis Workflow.\\nData Preprocessing Common Tools Measurement Validity\\n/C15 Data acquisition:\\nObtain or download\\n(often in an HTML\\nformat) text.\\n/C15 Tokenization: Break\\ntext into units (often\\nwords and sentences)\\nusing delimiters (e.g.,\\nperiods).\\n/C15 Cleaning: Remove\\nnonmeaningful text (e.g.,\\nHTML tags) and\\nnontextual information.\\n/C15 Removing stop words:\\nEliminate common\\nwords such as “a” or\\n“the” that appear in\\nmost documents.\\n/C15 Spelling: Correct\\nspelling mistakes using\\ncommon spellers.\\n/C15 Stemming and\\nlemmatization: Reduce\\nwords into their\\ncommon stem or lemma.\\n/C15 Entity extraction: Tools used to\\nextract the meaning of one word\\nat a time or simple cooccurrence\\nof words.

Lemmatization is similar to stem-\\nming, but it returns the proper lemma as opposed to the word’s root,\\nwhich may not be a meaningful word. For example, with stem-\\nming, the entities “car” and “cars” are stemmed to “car,” but\\n“automobile” is not. In lemmatization, the words “car,” “cars,”\\nand “automobile” are all reduced to the lemma “automobile.”\\nSeveral prepackaged stemmers exist in most text-mining tools\\n(e.g., the Porter stemmer). Similar to stop words, if the goal of the\\nanalysis is to extract the writing style, one may wish to skip the\\nstemming step, because stemming often masks the tense used.\\nText Analysis Extraction\\nOnce the data has been preprocessed, the researcher can start\\nanalyzing the data. One can distinguish between the extraction\\nof individual words or phrases (entity extraction), the extrac-\\ntion of themes or topics from the collective set of words or\\nphrases in the text (topic extraction), and the extraction of\\nrelationships between words or phrases (relation extraction).\\nTable 4 highlights these three types of analysis, the typical\\nresearch questions investigated with each approach, and some\\ncommonly used tools.\\nEntity (word) extraction.At the most basic level, text mining has\\nbeen used in marketing to extract individual entities (i.e., count\\nwords) such as person, location, brands, product attributes, emo-\\ntions, and adjectives. Entity extraction is probably the most\\ncommonly used text analysis approach in marketing academia\\nand practice, partly due to its relative simplicity. It allows the\\nresearcher to explore both what was written (the content of the\\nwords) as well as how it was written (the writing style). Entity\\nextraction can be used (1) to monitor discussions on social media\\n(e.g., numerous commercial companies offer buzz monitoring\\nservices and use entity extraction to track how frequently a brand\\nis being mentioned across alternative social media), (2) to gen-\\nerate a rich set of entities (words) to be used in a predictive\\nmodel (e.g., which words or entities are associated with fake\\nor fraudulent statements), and (3) as input to be used with dic-\\ntionaries to extract more complex forms of textual expressions,\\nsuch as a particular concept, sentiment, emotion, or writing style.\\nIn addition to programming languages such as Python and\\nR’s tm tool kits, software packages such as WordStat make it\\npossible to extract entities without coding. Entity extraction\\ncan also serve as input in commonly used dictionaries or lex-\\nicons. Dictionaries (i.e., a predefined list of words, such as a list\\nof brand names) are often used to classify entities into the\\ncategories (e.g., concepts, brands, people, categories, loca-\\ntions). In more formal text, capitalization can be used to help\\nTable 3.Data Preprocessing Steps.\\nData Processing Step Issues to Consider Illustration\\nData acquisition /C15 Is the data readily available in textual format or does the\\nresearch needs to use a web scraper to find the data?\\n/C15 What are the legal guidelines for using the data\\n(particularly relevant for web-scraped data)?\\nTweets mentioning different brands from the same\\ncategory during a particular time frame are\\ndownloaded from Twitter.\\nTokenization /C15 What is the unit of analysis (word, sentence, thread,\\nparagraph)?\\n/C15 Use smart tokenization for delimiters and adjust to\\nspecific unique delimiters found in the corpora.\\nThe unit of analysis is the individual tweet.

However, in more casual\\ntext, such as social media, such signals are less useful. Com-\\nmon dictionaries include LIWC (Pennebaker et al. 2015), EL\\n2.0 (Rocklage, Rucker, and Nordgren 2018), Diction 5.0, or\\nGeneral Inquirer for psychological states and traits (for exam-\\nple applications, see Berger and Milkman [2012]; Ludwig et al.\\n[2013]; Netzer, Lemaire, and Herzenstein [2019]).\\nSentiment dictionaries such as Hedonometer (Dodds et al.\\n2011), VADER (Hutto and Gilbert 2014), and LIWC can be used\\nto extract the sentiment of the text. One of the major limitations of\\nthe lexical approaches for sentiment analysis commonly used in\\nmarketing is that they apply a “bag of words” approach—meaning\\nt h a tw o r do r d e rd o e sn o tm a t t e r — a n dr e l ys o l e l yo nt h ec o o c c u r -\\nrence of a word of interest (e.g., “brand”) with positive or negative\\nwords (e.g., “great,” “bad”) in the same textual unit (e.g., a\\nreview). While dictionary approaches may be an easy way to\\nmeasure constructs and comparability across data sets, machine\\nlearning approaches trained by human-coded data (e.g., Borah and\\nTellis 2016; Hartmann et al. 2018; Hennig-Thurau, Wiertz, and\\nFeldhaus 2015) tend to be the most accurate way of measuring\\nsuch constructs (Hartmann et al. 2019), particularly if the construct\\nis complex or the domain is uncommon. For this reason, research-\\ners should carefully weigh the trade-off between empirical fit and\\ntheoretical commensurability, taking care to validate any diction-\\naries used in the analysis (discussed in the next section).\\nA specific type of entity extraction includes linguistic-type\\nentities such as part-of-speech tagging, which assigns a linguis-\\ntic tag (e.g., verb, noun, adjective) to each entity. Most text\\nanalysis tools (e.g., the tm package in R, the Natural Language\\nToolkit package in Python) have a built-in part-of-speech tag-\\nging tool. If no predefined dictionary exists, or the dictionary is\\nnot sufficient for the extraction needed, one could add hand-\\ncrafted rules to help define entities. However, the list of rules\\ncan become long, and the task of identifying and writing the\\nrules can be tedious. If the entity extraction by dictionaries or\\nrules is difficult or if the entities are less defined, machine\\nlearning–supervised classification approaches (e.g., condi-\\ntional random fields [Netzer et al. 2012], hidden Markov\\nmodels) or deep learning (Timoshenko and Hauser 2019) can\\nbe used to extract entities. Thelimitation of this approach is\\nthat often a relatively large hand-coded training data set needs\\nto be generated.\\nTo allow for a combination of words, entities can be defined\\nas a set of consecutive words, often referred to as n-grams,\\nwithout attempting to extract the relationship between these\\nentities (e.g., the consecutive words “credit card” can create\\nthe unigram entities “credit” and “card” as well as the bigram\\n“credit card”). This can be useful if the researcher is interested\\nin using the text as input for a predictive model.\\nIf the researcher wishes to extract entities while understanding\\nthe context in which the entities were mentioned in the text (thus\\navoiding the limitation of the bag-of-words approach), the emer-\\nging set of tools of word2vec or word embedding (Mikolov et al.\\n2013) can be employed. Word2vec maps each word or entity to a\\nvector of latent dimensions called embedding vector based on the\\nwords with which each focal word appears. This approach allows\\nthe researcher not only to extract words but also to understand the\\nsimilarity between words based on the similarities between the\\nembedding vectors (or the similarities between the sentences in\\nwhich each word appears). Thus, unlike the previous approaches\\ndiscussed thus far, word2vec preserves the context in which the\\nword appeared. While word embedding statistically captures the\\ncontext in which a word appears, it does not directly linguistically\\n“understand” the relationships among words.\\nTopic modeling.Entity extraction has two major limitations: (1)\\nthe dimensionality of the problem (often thousands of unique\\nentities are extracted) and (2) the interpretation of many enti-\\nties. Several topic modeling approaches have been suggested to\\novercome these limitations. Similar to how factor analysis\\nidentifies underlying themes among different survey items,\\ntopic modeling can identify the general topics (described as a\\ncombination of words) that are discussed in a body of text. This\\ntext summarization approach increases understanding of docu-\\nment content and is particularly useful when the objective is\\ninsight generation and interpretation rather than prediction\\n(e.g., Berger and Packard 2018; Tirunillai and Tellis 2014).\\nIn addition, monitoring topics, as opposed to words, makes it\\neasier to assess how discussion changes over time (e.g., Zhong\\nand Schweidel 2019).\\nMethodologically, topic modeling mimics the data-\\ngenerating process in which the writer chooses the topic she\\nwants to write about and then chooses the words to express\\nthese topics. Topics are defined as word distributions that com-\\nmonly co-occur and thus have a certain probability of appear-\\ning in a topic. A document is then described as a probabilistic\\nmixture of topics.\\nThe two most commonly used tools for topic modeling are\\nLDA (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003)and Poisson factorization\\n(PF; Gopalan, Hofman and Blei 2013). The predominant\\napproach prior to LDA and PF was the support-vector-\\nmachine latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach. While LSA\\nis simpler and faster to implement than LDA and PF, it\\nrequires larger textual corpora and often achieves lower accu-\\nracy levels. Other approaches include building an ontology of\\ntopics using a combination of human classification of docu-\\nments as seeding for a machine learning classification (e.g.,\\nMoon and Kamakura 2017). Whereas LDA is often simpler to\\napply than PF, PF has the advantage of not assuming that the\\ntopic probabilities must sum toone. That is, some documents\\nmay have more topic presences than others, and a document\\ncan have multiple topics with high likelihood of occurrence.\\nIn addition, PF tends to be more stable with shorter text.\\nBu¨schken and Allenby (2016) relax the common bag-of-\\nwords assumption underlying the traditional LDA model and\\nleverage the within-sentence dependencies of online reviews.\\nLDA2vec is another approach toassess topics while account-\\ning for the sequence context in which the word appears\\n(Moody 2016). In the context of search queries, Liu and Tou-\\nbia (2018) further extend the LDA approach to hierarchical\\nLDA for cases in which related documents (queries and search\\nresults) are used to extract the topics. Furthermore, the\\nBerger et al. 11 researcher can use an unsupervised or seeded LDA approach\\nto incorporate prior knowledge in the construction and inter-\\npretation of the topics (e.g., Puranam, Narayan, and Kadiyali\\n2017; Toubia et al. 2019).\\nWhile topic modeling methods often produce very sensible\\ntopics, because topics are selected solely based on a statistical\\napproach, the selection of the number of topics and the inter-\\npretation of some topics can be challenging. It is recommended\\nto combine statistical approaches (e.g., the perplexity measure,\\nwhich is a model fit–based measure) and researcher judgment\\nwhen selecting the number of topics.\\nRelation extraction. At the most basic level, relationships\\nbetween entities can be captured by the mere co-occurrence\\nof entities (e.g., Boghrati and Berger 2019; Netzer et al.\\n2012; Toubia and Netzer 2017). However, marketing research-\\ners are often more interested in identifying textual relationships\\namong extracted entities, such as the relationships between\\nproducts, attributes, and sentiments. Such relationships are\\noften more relevant for the firm than merely measuring the\\nvolume of brand mentions or even the overall brand sentiment.\\nFor example, researchers may want to identify whether consu-\\nmers mentioned a particular problem with a specific product\\nfeature. Feldman et al. (2015) and Netzer et al. (2012) provide\\nsuch examples by identifying the textual relationships between\\ndrugs and adverse drug reactions that imply that a certain drug\\nmay cause a particular adverse reaction.\\nRelation extraction also offers a more advanced route to\\ncapture sentiment by providing the link between an entity of\\ninterest (e.g., a brand) and the sentiment expressed, beyond\\ntheir mere cooccurrence. Relation extraction based on the\\nbag-of-words approach, which treats the sentence as a bag\\nof unsorted words and searches for word cooccurrence, is\\nlimited because the cooccurrence of words may not imply a\\nrelationship. For example, the cooccurrence of a drug (e.g.,\\nAdvil) with a symptom (e.g., headache) may refer to the\\nsymptom as a side effect of the drug or as the effect the drug\\nis aiming to alleviate. Addressing such relationships requires\\nidentifying the sequence of words and the linguistic relation-\\nship among them. There have been only limited applications\\nof such relation extraction in marketing, primarily due to the\\ncomputational and linguistic complexities involved in accu-\\nrately making such relational inferences from unstructured\\ndata (see, e.g., the diabetes drugs application in Netzer et al.\\n[2012]). However, as the methodologies used to extract entity\\nrelations evolve, we expect thisto be a promising direction for\\nmarketers to take.\\nThe most commonly used approaches for relation extraction\\nare handwritten relationship rules, supervised machine learning\\napproaches, and a combination of these approaches. At the\\nmost basic level, the researcher could write a set of rules that\\ndescribe the required relationship. An example of such a rule\\nmay be the co-occurrence of product (e.g., “Ford”), attribute\\n(e.g., “oil consumption”), and problem (e.g., “excessive”).\\nHowever, such approaches tend to require many handwritten\\nrules and have low recall (they miss many relations) and thus\\nare becoming less popular.\\nA more common approach is to train a supervised machine\\nlearning tool. This could be linguistic agnostic approaches\\n(e.g., deep learning) or natural language processing (NLP)\\napproaches that aim to understand the linguisticrelationship\\nin the sentence. Such an approach requires a relatively large\\ntraining data set provided by human coders in which various\\nrelationships (e.g., sentim ent) are observed. One readily\\navailable tool for NLP-based relationship extraction is the\\nStanford Sentence and Grammatical Dependency Parser\\n(http://nlp.stanf ord.edu:8080/parser/). The tool identifies the\\ngrammatical role of different words in the sentence to identify\\ntheir relationship. For example, to assign a sentiment to a\\nparticular attribute, the parser first identifies the presence of\\nan emotion word and then, in cases where a subject is present,\\nautomatically assesses if there is a grammatical relationship\\n(e.g., in the sentence “the hotelwas very nice,” the adjective\\n“nice” relates to the subject “hotel”). As with many off-the-\\nshelf tools, the validity of the tool for a specific relation\\nextraction needs to be tested.\\nFinally, beyond the relations between words/entities within\\none document, text can also be investigated across documents\\n(e.g., online reviews, academic articles). For example, a tem-\\nporal sequence of documents or a portfolio of documents across\\na group or community of communicators can be examined for\\ninterdependencies (Ludwig et al. 2013, 2014).\\nText Analysis Metrics\\nEarly work in marketing has tended to summarize unstructured\\ntext with structured proxies for this data. For example, in online\\nreviews, researchers have used volume (e.g., Godes and Mayzlin\\n2004; Moe and Trusov 2011); valence, often captured by numeric\\nratings that supplement the text (e.g., Godes and Silva 2012; Moe\\nand Schweidel 2012; Ying, Feinberg and Wedel 2006); and var-\\niance, often captured using entropy-type measures (e.g., Godes\\nand Mayzlin 2004). However, these quantifiable metrics often\\nmask the richness of the text. Several common metrics are often\\nused to quantify the text itself, as we explain next.\\nCount measures.Count measures have been used to measure the\\nfrequency of each entity’s occurrence, entities’ co-occurrence,\\nor entities’ relations. For example, when using dictionaries to\\nevaluate sentiment or other categories, researchers often use\\nthe proportion of negative and/or positive words in the docu-\\nment, or the difference between the two (Berger and Milkman\\n2012; Borah and Tellis 2016; Pennebaker et al. 2015; Schwei-\\ndel and Moe 2014; Tirunillai and Tellis 2014). The problem\\nwith simple counts is that longer documents are likely to\\ninclude more occurrences of every entity. For that reason,\\nresearchers often focus on the proportions of words in the\\ndocument that belong to a particular category (e.g., positive\\nsentiment). The limitation of this simple measure is that some\\nwords are more likely to appear than others. For example, the\\n12 Journal of Marketing 84(1) word “laptop” is likely to appear in almost every review in\\ncorpora that is composed of laptop reviews.\\nAccuracy measures. When evaluating the accuracy of text mea-\\nsures relative to human-coded or externally validated docu-\\nments, measures of recall and precision are often used.\\nRecall is the proportion of entities in the original text that the\\ntext-mining algorithm was able to successfully identify (it is\\ndefined by the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives\\nand false negatives). Precision is the proportion of correctly\\nidentified entities from all entities identified (it is defined by\\nthe ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false\\npositives). On their own, recall and precision measures are\\ndifficult to assess because an improvement in one often comes\\nat the expense of the other. For example, if one defines that\\nevery entity in the corpora is a brand, recall for brands will be\\nperfect (you will never miss a brand if it exists in the text), but\\nprecision will be very low (there will be many false positive\\nidentifications of a brand entity).\\nTo create the balance between recall and precision, one can\\nuse the F1 measure—a harmonic mean of the levels of recall\\nand precision. If the researcher is more concerned with false\\npositives than false negatives (e.g., it is more important to\\nidentify positives than negatives), recall and precision can be\\nweighted differently. Alternatively, for unbalanced data with\\nhigh proportions of true or false in the populations, a receiver\\noperating characteristics curve can be used to reflect the rela-\\ntionship between true positives and false positives, and the area\\nunder the curve is often used as a measure of accuracy.\\nSimilarity measures.In some cases, the researcher is interested in\\nmeasuring the similarity between documents (e.g., Ludwig\\net al. 2013). How similar is the language used in two adver-\\ntisements? How different is a song from its genre? In such\\ncases, measures such as linguistic style matching, similarity\\nin topic use (Berger and Packard 2018), cosine similarity, and\\nthe Jaccard index (e.g., Toubia and Netzer 2017) can be used to\\nassess the similarity between the text of two documents.\\nReadability measures.In some cases, the researcher is interested\\nin evaluating the readability of the text. Readability can reflect\\nthe sophistication of the writer and/or the ability of the reader to\\ncomprehend the text (e.g., Ghose and Ipeirotis 2011). Common\\nreadability measures include the Flesch–Kincaid reading ease\\nand the simple measure of gobbledygook (SMOG) measures.\\nThese measures often use metrics such as average number of\\nsyllables and average number of words per sentence to evaluate\\nthe readability of the text. Readability measures often grade the\\ntext on a 1–12 scale reflecting the U.S. school grade-level\\nneeded to comprehend the text. Common text-mining packages\\nhave built-in readability tools.\\nThe Validity of Text-Based Constructs\\nWhile the availability of text has opened up a range of research\\nquestions, for textual data to provide value, one must be able to\\nestablish its validity. Both internal validity (i.e., does text\\naccurately measure the constructs and the relationship between\\nthem?) and external validity (i.e., do the test-based findings\\napply to phenomena outside the study?) can be established in\\nvarious ways (Humphreys and Wang 2017). Table 5 describes\\nhow the text analysis can be evaluated to improve different\\ntypes of validity (Cook and Campbell 1979).\\nInternal Validity\\nInternal validity is often a major threat in the context of text\\nanalysis because the mapping between words and the underly-\\ning dimension the research aims to measure (e.g., psychologi-\\ncal state and traits) is rarely straightforward and can vary across\\ncontexts and textual outlets (e.g., formal news vs. social\\nmedia). In addition, given the relatively young field of auto-\\nmated text analysis, validation of many of the methods and\\nconstructs is still ongoing.\\nAccordingly, it is important to confirm the internal validity\\nof the approach used. A range of methods can be adopted to\\nensure construct, concurrent, convergent, discriminant, and\\ncausal validity. In general, the approach for ensuring internal\\nvalidity is to ensure that the text studied accurately reflects the\\ntheoretical concept or topic being studied, does so in a way that\\nis congruent with prior literature, is discriminant from other\\nrelated constructs, and provides ample and careful evidence for\\nthe claims of the research.\\nConstruct validity.Construct validity (i.e., does the text represent\\nthe theoretical concept?) is perhaps the most important to\\naddress when studying text. Threats to construct validity occur\\nwhen the text provides improper or misleading evidence of the\\nconstruct. For instance, researchers often rely on existing stan-\\ndardized dictionaries to extract constructs to ensure that their\\nwork is comparable with other work. However, these diction-\\naries may not always fit the particular context. For example,\\nextracting sentiment from financial reports using sentiment\\ntools developed for day-to-day language may not be appropri-\\nate. Particularly when attempting to extract complex constructs\\n(e.g., psychological states and traits, relationships between con-\\nsumers and products, and even sentiment), researchers should\\nattempt to validate the constructs on the specific application to\\nensure that what is being extracted from the text is indeed what\\nthey intended to extract. Construct validity can also be chal-\\nlenged when homonyms or other words do not accurately\\nreflect what researchers think they do.\\nStrategies for addressing threats to construct validity require\\nthat researchers examine how the instances counted in the data\\nconnect to the theoretical concept(s) (Humphreys and Wang\\n2017). Dictionaries can also be validated using a saturation\\napproach, pulling a subsample of coded entries and verifying\\nwith a hit rate of approximately 80% (Weber 2005). Another\\nmethod is to use input from human coders, as is done to support\\nmachine learning applications (as previously discussed). For\\nexample, one can use Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to\\nlabel phrases on a scale from “very negative” to “very positive”\\nfor sentiment analysis and then use these words to create a\\nBerger et al. 13 weighted dictionary. In many cases, multiple methods for dic-\\ntionary validation are advisable to ensure that one is achieving\\nboth theoretical and empirical fit. For topic modeling, research-\\ners infer topics from a list of cooccurring words. However,\\nthese are theoretical inferences made by researchers. As such,\\nconstruct validity is equally important and can be ascertained\\nusing some of the same methods of validation, through satura-\\ntion and calculating a hit rate through manual analysis of a\\nsubset of the data. When using a classification approach, con-\\nfusion matrices can be produced to provide details on accuracy,\\nfalse positives, and false negatives (Das and Chen 2007).\\nConcurrent validity. Concurrent validity concerns the way that\\nthe researcher’s operationalization of the construct relates to\\nprior operationalizations. Threats to concurrent validity often\\ncome when researchers create text-based measures inductively\\nfrom the text. For instance, if one develops a topic model from\\nthe text, it will be based on the data set and may not therefore\\nproduce topics that are comparable with previous research. To\\naddress these threats, one should compare the operationaliza-\\ntion with other research and other data sources. For example,\\nSchweidel and Moe (2014) propose a measure of brand senti-\\nment based on social media text data and validate it by\\nTable 5.Text Analysis Validation Techniques.\\nType of Validity Validation Technique Description of Method for Validation References\\nInternal Validity\\nConstruct validity Dictionary validation After draft dictionary is created, pull 10% of the sample\\nand calculate the hit rate.

Based on this data, the dictionary can also\\nbe weighted to reflect the survey data.\\nBrysbaert, Warriner, and\\nKuperman (2014)a\\nHave three coders evaluate the dictionary categories. If\\ntwo of the three coders agree that the word is part of\\nthe category, include; if not, exclude.

(2014)\\nRobustness Different statistical\\nmeasures, unitizations\\nUse different, but comparable, statistical measures or\\nalgorithms (e.g., lift, cosine similarity, Jaccard\\nsimilarity), aggregate at different levels (e.g., day,\\nmonth)\\nNetzer et al. (2012)\\naReference appears in the Web Appendix.\\n14 Journal of Marketing 84(1) comparing it with brand measures obtained through a tradi-\\ntional marketing research surv ey. Similarly, Netzer et al.\\n(2012) compare the market structure maps derived from textual\\ninformation with those derived from product switching and\\nsurveys, and Tirunillai and Tellis (2014) compare the topics\\nthey identify with those found inConsumer Reports.W h e n\\nstudying linguistic style (Pennebaker and King 1999), for\\nexample, it is beneficial to use robust measures from prior\\nliterature where factor analysis and other methods have already\\nbeen employed to create the construct.\\nConvergent validity. Convergent validity ensures that multiple\\nmeasurements of the construct (i.e., words) all converge to the\\nsame concept. Convergent validity can be threatened when\\nthe measures of the construct do not align or have different\\neffects. Convergent validity can be enhanced by using several\\nsubstantively different measures (e.g., dictionaries) of the\\nsame construct to look for converging patterns. For example,\\nwhen studying posts about the stock market, Das and Chen\\n(2007) compare five classifiers for measuring sentiment,\\nc o m p a r i n gt h e mi nac o n f u s i o nm a t r i xt oe x a m i n ef a l s ep o s i -\\ntives. Convergent evidence can also come from creating a\\ncorrelation or similarity matrix of words or concepts and\\nchecking for patterns that have face validity. For instance,\\nHumphreys (2010) looks for patterns between the concept\\nof crime and negative sentiment to provide convergent evi-\\ndence that crime is negatively valenced in the data.\\nDiscriminant validity. Discriminant validity, the degree to which\\nthe construct measures are sufficiently different from measures\\nof other constructs, can be threatened when the measurement of\\nthe construct is very similar to that of another construct. For\\ninstance, measurements of sentiment and emotion in many\\ncases may not seem different because they are measured using\\nsimilar word lists or, when using classification, return the same\\ngroup of words as predictors. Strategies for ensuring discrimi-\\nnant validity entail looking for discriminant rather than con-\\nvergent patterns and boundary conditions (i.e., when and how\\nis sentiment different from emotion?). Furthermore, theoretical\\nrefinements can be helpful in drawing finer distinctions. For\\nexample, anxiety, anger, and sadness are different kinds of\\nemotion (and can be measured via psychometrically different\\nscales), whereas sentiment is usually measured as positive,\\nnegative, or neutral (Pennebaker et al. 2015).\\nCausal validity. Causal validity is the degree to which the con-\\nstruct, as operationalized in the data set, is actually the cause of\\nanother construct or outcome, and it is best ascertained through\\nrandom assignment in controlled lab conditions. Any number\\nof external factors can threaten causal validity. However, steps\\ncan be taken to enhance causal validity in naturally occurring\\ntextual data. In particular, rival hypotheses and other explana-\\ntory factors for the proposed causal relationship can be statis-\\ntically controlled for in the model. For example, Ludwig et al.\\n(2013) include price discount in the model when studying the\\nrelationship between product reviews and conversion rate to\\ncontrol for this factor.\\nExternal Validity\\nTo achieve external validity, researchers should attempt to\\nensure that the effects found in the text apply outside of the\\nresearch framework. Because text analysis often uses natu-\\nrally occurring data that is often of large magnitude, it tends\\nhave a relatively high degree of external validity relative to,\\nfor example, lab experiments. However, establishing external\\nvalidity is still necessary due to threats to validity from sam-\\npling bias, overfitting, and single-method bias. For example,\\nonline reviews may be biased due to self-selection among\\nthose who elected to review a product (Schoenmu¨ller, Netzer,\\nand Stahl 2019).\\nPredictive validity. Predictive validity is threatened when the\\nconstruct, though perhaps properly measured, does not have\\nthe expected effects on a meaningful second variable. For\\nexample, if consumer sentiment falls but customer satisfac-\\ntion remains high, predictive validity could be called into\\nquestion. To ensure predictive validity, text-based constructs\\ncan be linked to key performance measures such as sales (e.g.,\\nFossen and Schweidel 2019) or consumer engagement (Ash-\\nley and Tuten 2015). If a particular construct has been theo-\\nretically linked to a performancemetric, then any text-based\\nmeasure of that construct should also be linked to that perfor-\\nmance metric. Tirunillai and Tellis (2012) show that the vol-\\nume of Twitter activity affects stock price, but they find\\nmixed results for the predictive validity of sentiment, with\\nnegative sentiment being predictive but positive sentiment\\nhaving no effect.\\nGeneralizability can be threatened when researchers base\\nresults on a single data set because it is unknown whether the\\nfindings, model, or algorithm would apply in the same way to\\nother texts or outside of textual measurements. Generalizability\\nof the results can be established by viewing the results of text\\nanalysis along with other measures of attitude and behavioral\\noutcomes. For example, Netzer et al. (2012) test their substan-\\ntive conclusions and methodology on message boards of both\\nautomobile discussions and drug discussions from WebMD.\\nEvaluating the external validity and generalizability of the\\nfindings is key, because the analysis of text drawn from a\\nparticular source may not reflect consumers more broadly\\n(e.g., Schweidel and Moe 2014).\\nRobustness. Robustness can be limited when there is only one\\nmetric or method used in the model. Researchers can ensure\\nrobustness by using different measures for relationships (e.g.,\\nPearson correlation, cosine similarity, lift) and probing results\\nby relaxing different assumptions. The use of holdout samples\\nand k-fold cross-validation methods can prevent researchers\\nfrom overfitting their models and ensure that relationships\\nfound in the data set will hold with other data as well (Jurafsky\\net al. 2014; see also Humphreys and Wang 2017). Probing on\\nBerger et al. 15 different “cuts” of the data can also help. Berger and Packard\\n(2018), for example, compare lyrics from different genres, and\\nLudwig et al. (2013) include reviews of both fiction and non-\\nfiction books.\\nFinally, researchers should bear in mind the limitations of\\ntext itself. There are thoughts and feelings that consumers,\\nmanagers, or other stakeholders may not express in text. The\\nform of communication (e.g., tweets, annual reports) may also\\nshape the message; some constructs may not be explicit enough\\nto be measured with automated text analysis. Furthermore,\\nwhile textual information can often involve large samples,\\nthese samples may not be representative. Twitter users, for\\nexample, tend to be younger and more educated (Smith and\\nAnderson 2018). Those who contribute textual information,\\nparticularly in social media, may represent polarized points\\nof view. When evaluating cultural products or social media,\\none should consider the system in which they are generated.\\nOften viewpoints are themselves filtered through a cultural\\nsystem (Hirsch 1986; McCracken 1988) or elevated by an algo-\\nrithm, and the products make it through this process may share\\ncertain characteristics. For this reason, researchers and firms\\nshould use caution when making attributions on the basis of a\\ncultural text. It is not necessarily a reflection of reality (Jame-\\nson 2005) but rather may represent ideals, extremes, or insti-\\ntutionalized perceptions, depending on the context.\\nFuture Research Agenda\\nWe hope this article encourages more researchers and practi-\\ntioners to think about how they can incorporate textual data into\\ntheir research. Communication and linguistics are at the core of\\nstudying text in marketing. Automated text analysis opens the\\nblack box of interactions, allowing researchers to directly\\naccess what is being said and how it is said in marketplace\\ncommunication. The notion of text as indicative of meaning-\\nmaking processes creates fascinating and truly novel research\\nquestions and challenges. There are many methods and\\napproaches available, and there is no space to do all of them\\njustice. While we have discussed several research streams,\\ngiven the novelty of text analysis, there are still ample oppor-\\ntunities for future research, which we discuss next.\\nUsing Text to Reach Across the Marketing Discipline\\nReturning to how text analysis can unite the tribes of market-\\ning, it is worth highlighting a few areas that have mostly been\\nexamined by one research tradition in marketing where fruitful\\ncross-pollination between tribes is possible through text anal-\\nysis. Brand communities were first identified and studied by\\nresearchers coming from a sociology perspective (Mun˜iz and\\nO’Guinn 2001). Later, qualitative and quantitative researchers\\nfurther refined the concepts, identifying a distinct set of roles\\nand status in the community (e.g., Mathwick, Wiertz, and De\\nRuyter 2007). Automated text analysis allows researchers to\\nstudy how consumers in these communities interact at scale\\nand in a more quantifiable manner—for instance, examining\\nhow people with different degrees of power use language and\\npredict group outcomes based on quantifiably different\\ndynamics (e.g., Manchanda, Packard, and Pattabhitamaiah\\n2015). Researchers can track influence, for example, by inves-\\ntigating which types of users initiate certain words or phrases\\nand which others pick up on them. Research could examine\\nwhether people begin to enculturate to the language of the\\ncommunity over time and predict which individuals may be\\nmore likely to stay or leave on the basis of how well they adapt\\nto the group’s language (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. 2013;\\nSrivastava and Goldberg 2017). Quantitative or machine learn-\\ning researchers might capture the most commonly discussed\\ntopics and how these dynamically change over the evolution\\nof the community. Interpretive researchers might examine how\\nthese terms link conceptually, to find underlying community\\nnorms that lead members to stay. Marketing strategy research-\\ners might then use or develop dictionaries to connect these\\ncommunities to firm performance and to offer directions for\\nfirms regarding how to keep members participating across dif-\\nferent brand communities (or contexts).\\nThe progression can flow the other way as well. Outside of a\\nfew early investigations (e.g., Dichter 1966), word of mouth\\nwas originally studied by quantitative researchers interested in\\nwhether interpersonal communication actually drove individ-\\nual and market behavior (e.g., Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006;\\nIyengar, Van den Bulte, and Valente 2011). More recently,\\nhowever, behavioral researchers have begun to study the under-\\nlying drivers of word of mouth, looking at why people talk\\nabout and share some stories, news, and information rather than\\nothers (Berger and Milkman 2012; De Angelis et al. 2012; for a\\nreview, see Berger [2014]). Marketing strategy researchers\\nmight track the text of word-of-mouth interactions to predict\\nthe emergence of brand crises or social media firestorms (e.g.,\\nZhong and Schweidel 2019) as well as when, if, and how to\\nrespond (Herhausen et al. 2019).\\nConsumer–firm interaction is also a rich area to examine.\\nBehavioral researchers could use the data from call centers to\\nbetter understand interpersonal communication between con-\\nsumers and firms and record what drives customer satisfaction\\n(e.g., Packard and Berger 2019a; Packard, Moore, and McFer-\\nran 2018). The back-and-forth between customers and agents\\ncould be used to understand conversational dynamics. More\\nquantitative researchers should use the textual features of call\\ncenters to predict outcomes such as churn and even go beyond\\ntext to examine vocal features such as tone, volume, and speed\\nof speech. Marketing strategy researchers could use calls to\\nunderstand how customer-centric a company is or assess the\\nquality, style, and impact of its sales personnel.\\nFinally, it is worth noting that different tribes not only have\\ndifferent skill sets but also often study substantively different\\ntypes of textual communication. Consumer-to-consumer com-\\nmunication is often studied by researchers in consumer beha-\\nvior, whereas marketing strategy researchers more often tend to\\nstudy firm-to-consumer and firm-to-firm communication. Col-\\nlaboration among researchers from the different subfields may\\nallow them to combine these different sources of textual data.\\n16 Journal of Marketing 84(1) There is ample opportunity to apply theory developed in one\\ndomain to enhance another. Marketing strategy researchers, for\\nexample, often use transaction economics to study business-to-\\nbusiness relationships through agency theory, but these\\napproaches may be equally beneficial when studying\\nconsumer-to-consumer communications.\\nBroadening the Scope of Text Research\\nAs noted in Table 1, certain text flows have been studied more\\nthan others. A large portion of ex i s t i n gw o r kh a sf o c u s e do n\\nconsumers communicating to one another through social\\nmedia and online reviews. The relative availability of such\\ndata has made it a rich area of study and an opportunity to\\napply text analysis to marketing problems.3 Furthermore, for\\nthis area to grow, researchers need to branch out. This\\nincludes expanding (1) data sources, (2) actors examined, and\\n(3) research topics.\\nExpand data sources used.Offline word of mouth, for example,\\ncan be examined to study what people talk about and conversa-\\ntional dynamics. Doctor–patient interactions can be studied to\\nunderstand what drives medical adherence. Text items such as\\nyearbook entries, notes passed between students, or the text of\\nspeed dating conversations can be used to examine relationship\\nformation, maintenance, and dissolution. Using offline data\\nrequires carefully transcribing content, which increases the\\namount of effort required but opens up a range of interesting\\navenues of study. For example, we know very little about the\\ndifferences between online recommendations and face-to-face\\nrecommendations, where the latter also include the interplay\\nbetween verbal and nonverbal information. Moreover, in the\\nnew era of “perpetual contact” our understanding of cross-\\nmessage and cross-channel implications is limited. Research\\nby Batra and Keller (2016) and Villarroel Ordenes et al.\\n(2018) suggests that appropriate sequencing of messages mat-\\nters; it might similarly matter across channels and modality.\\nGiven the rise of technology-enabled realities (e.g., augmented\\nreality, virtual reality, mixed reality), assistive robotics, and\\nsmart speakers, understanding the roles and potential differ-\\nences between language and nonverbal cues could be achieved\\nusing these novel data sources.\\nExpand dyads between text producers and text receivers.There are\\nnumerous dyads relevant to marketing in which text plays a\\ncrucial role. We discuss just a few of the areas that deserve\\nadditional research.\\nConsidering consumer–firm interactions, we expect to see\\nmore research leveraging the rich information exchanged\\nbetween consumers and firms through call centers and chats\\n(e.g., Packard and Berger 2019a; Packard, Moore, and McFer-\\nran 2018). These interactions often reflect inbound\\ncommunication between customers and the firm, which can\\nhave important implications for the relationship between par-\\nties. In addition, how might the language used on packaging or\\nin brand mission statements reflect the nature of organizations\\nand their relationship to their consumers? How might the lan-\\nguage that is most impactful in sales interactions differ from the\\nlanguage that is most useful in customer service interactions?\\nResearch could also probe how the impact of such language\\nvaries across contexts. The characteristics of language used by\\nconsumer packaged goods brands and pharmaceuticals brands\\nin direct-to-consumer advertising likely differ. Similarly, the\\nway in which consumers process the language used in disclo-\\nsures in advertisements for pharmaceuticals (e.g., Narayanan,\\nDesiraju, and Chintagunta 2004) and political candidates (e.g.,\\nWang, Lewis, and Schweidel 2018) may vary.\\nTurning to firm-to-firm interactions, most conceptual\\nframeworks on business-to-business (B2B) exchange relations\\nemphasize the critical role of communication (e.g., Palmatier,\\nDant, and Grewal 2007). Communicational aspects have been\\nlinked to important B2B relational measures such as commit-\\nment, trust, dependence, relationship satisfaction, and relation-\\nship quality. Yet research on actual, word-level B2B\\ncommunication is very limited. For example, very little\\nresearch has examined the types of information exchanged\\nbetween salespeople and customers in offline settings. The\\nability to gather and transcribe data at scale points to important\\nopportunities to do so. As for within-firm communication,\\nresearchers could study informal communications such as\\nmarketing-related emails, memos, and agendas generated by\\nfirms and consumed by their employees.\\nSimilarly, while a great deal of work in accounting and\\nfinance has begun to use annual reports as a data source (for\\na review, see Loughran and McDonald [2016]), marketing\\nresearchers have paid less attention to this area to study com-\\nmunication with investors. Most research has used this data to\\npredict outcomes such as stock performance and other mea-\\nsures of firm valuation. Given recent interest in linking\\nmarketing-related activities to firm valuation (e.g., McCarthy\\nand Fader 2018), this may be an area to pursue further. All firm\\ncommunication, including required documents such as annual\\nreports or discretionary forms of communication such as adver-\\ntising and sales interactions, can be used to measure variables\\nsuch as market orientation, marketing capabilities, marketing\\nleadership styles, and even a firm’s brand personality.\\nThere are also ample research opportunities in the interac-\\ntions between consumers, firms, and society. Data about the\\nbroader cultural and normative environment of firms, such as\\nnews media and government reports, may be useful to shed\\nlight on the forces that shape markets. To understand how a\\ncompany such as Uber navigates resistance to market change,\\nfor example, one might study transcripts of town hall meetings\\nand other government documents in which citizen input is\\nheard and answered. Exogenous shocks in the forms of social\\nmovements such as #metoo and #blacklivesmatter have\\naffected marketing communication and brand image. One\\npotential avenue for future research is to take a cultural\\n3 While readily available data facilitates research, there are downsides to be\\nrecognized, including the representatives of such data and the terms of service\\nthat govern the use of this data.\\nBerger et al. 17 branding approach (Holt 2016) to study how different publics\\ndefine, shape, and advocate for certain meanings in the market-\\nplace. Firms and their brands do not exist in a vacuum, inde-\\npendent of the society in which they operate. Yet limited\\nresearch in marketing has considered how text can be used to\\nderive firms’ intentions and actions at the societal level. For\\nexample, scholars have shown how groups of consumers such\\nas locavores (i.e., people who eat locally grown food; Thomp-\\nson and Coskuner-Balli 2007), fashionistas (Scaraboto and\\nFischer 2012), and bloggers (McQuarrie, Miller, and Phillips\\n2012) shape markets. Through text analysis, the effect of the\\nintentions of these social groups on the market can then be\\nmeasured and better understood.\\nAnother opportunity for future research is the use of textual\\ndata to study culture and cultural success. Topics such as cul-\\ntural propagation, artistic change, and the diffusion of innova-\\ntions have been examined across disciplines with the goal of\\nunderstanding why certain products succeed while others fail\\n(Bass 1969; Boyd and Richerson 1986; Cavalli-Sforza and\\nFeldman 1981; Rogers 1995; Salganik, Dodds, and Watts\\n2006; Simonton 1980). While success may be random (Bielby\\nand Bielby 1994; Hirsch 1972), another possibility is that cul-\\ntural items succeed or fail on the basis of their fit with con-\\nsumers (Berger and Heath 2005). By quantifying aspects of\\nbooks, movies, or other cultural items quickly and at scale,\\nresearchers can measure whether concrete narratives are more\\nengaging, whether more emotionally volatile movies are more\\nsuccessful, whether songs that use certain linguistic features are\\nmore likely to top the Billboard charts, and whether books that\\nevoke particular emotions se ll more copies. While not as\\nwidely available as social media data, more and more data on\\ncultural items has recently become available. Data sets such as\\nthe Google Books corpus (Akpinar and Berger 2015), song\\nlyric websites, or movie script databases provide a wealth of\\ninformation. Such data could enable analyses of narrative\\nstructure to identify “basic plots” (e.g., Reagan et al. 2016; Van\\nLaer et al. 2019).\\nKey Marketing Constructs (That Could Be) Measured\\nwith Text\\nBeginning with previously developed ways of representing\\nmarketing constructs can help some researchers address valid-\\nity concerns. This section details a few of these constructs to\\naid researchers who are beginning to use text analysis in their\\nwork (see the Web Appendix). Using prior operationalization\\nof a construct can ensure concurrent validity—helping build\\nthe literature in a particular domain—but researchers should\\ntake steps to ensure that the prior operationalization has con-\\nstruct validity with their data set.\\nAt the individual level, sentiment and satisfaction are per-\\nhaps some of the most common measurements (e.g., Bu¨schken\\nand Allenby, 2016; Homburg, Ehm, and Artz 2015; Herhausen\\net al. 2019; Ma, Baohung, and Kekre 2015; Schweidel and Moe\\n2014) and have been validated in numerous contexts. Other\\naspects that may be extracted from text include the authenticity\\nand emotionality of language, which have also been explored\\nthrough robust surveys and scales or by combining multiple\\nexisting measurements (e.g., Mogilner, Kamvar, and Aaker\\n2011; Van Laer et al. 2019). There are also psychological con-\\nstructs, such as personality type and construal level (Kern et al.\\n2016; Snefjella and Kuperman 2015), that are potentially use-\\nful for marketing researchers and could also be inferred from\\nthe language used by consumers.\\nFuture work in marketing studying individuals might con-\\nsider measurements of social identification and engagement.\\nThat is, researchers currently have an idea of positive or neg-\\native consumer sentiment, but they are only beginning to\\nexplore emphasis (e.g., Rocklage and Fazio 2015), trust, com-\\nmitment, and other modal properties. To this end, harnessing\\nlinguistic theory of pragmatics and examining phatics over\\nsemantics could be useful (see, e.g., Villarroel et al. 2017).\\nOnce such work is developed, we recommend that researchers\\ncarefully validate approaches proposed to measure such con-\\nstructs along the lines described previously.\\nAt the firm level, constructshave been identified in firm-\\nproduced text such as annual reports and press releases. Mar-\\nket orientation, advertising goals, future orientation, deceitful\\nintentions, firm focus, and innovation orientation have all\\nbeen measured and validated using this material (see Web\\nAppendix Table 1). Work in organizational studies has a his-\\ntory of using text analysis in this area and might provide some\\ninspiration and validation in the study of the existence of\\nmanagerial frames for sensemaking and the effect of activists\\non firm activities.\\nFuture work in marketing at the firm level could further\\nrefine and diversify measurements of strategic orientation\\n(e.g., innovation orientation, market-driving vs. market-\\ndriven orientations). Difficult-to-measure factors deep in the\\norganizational culture, str ucture, or capabilities may be\\nrevealed in the words the firm, its employees, and external\\nstakeholders use to describe it (see Molner, Prabhu, and Yadav\\n[2019]). Likewise, the mindsets and management style of mar-\\nketing leaders may be discerned from the text they use (see\\nYadav, Prabhu, and Chandy [2007]). Firm attributes that are\\nimportant outcomes of firm action (e.g., brand value) could\\nalso be explored using text (e.g., Herhausen et al. 2019). In\\nthis case, there is an opportunity to use new kinds of data. For\\ninstance, internal, employee-based brand value could be mea-\\nsured with text on LinkedIn or Glassdoor. Finally, more subtle\\nattributes of firm language, including conflict, ambiguity, or\\nopenness, might provide some insight into the effects of man-\\nagerial language on firm success. For this, it may be useful to\\nexamine less formal textual data of interactions such as\\nemployee emails, salesperson calls, or customer service cen-\\nter calls.\\nLess work in marketing has measured constructs on the\\nsocial or cultural level, but work in this vein tends to focus\\non how firms fit into the cultural fabric of existing meanings\\nand norms. For instance, institutional logics and legitimacy\\nhave been measured by analyzing media text, as has the rise\\n18 Journal of Marketing 84(1) of brand publics that increase discussion of brands within a\\nculture (Arvidsson and Caliandro 2016).\\nAt the cultural level, marketing research is likely to maintain\\na focus on how firms fit into the cultural environment, but it\\nmay also look to how the cultural environment affects consu-\\nmers. For instance, measurement of cultural uncertainty, risk,\\nhostility, and change could benefit researchers interested in the\\neffects of culture on both consumer and firm effects as well as\\nthe effects of culture and society on government and investor\\nrelationships. Measuring openness and diversity through text\\nare also timely topics to explore and might inspire innovations\\nin measurement, focusing on, for example, language diversity\\nrather than the specific content of language. Important cultural\\ndiscourses such as language around debt and credit could also\\nbe better understood through text analysis. Measurement of\\ngender- and race- related language could be useful in exploring\\ndiversity and inclusion in the way firms and consumers react to\\ntext from a diverse set of writers.\\nOpportunities and Challenges Provided by\\nMethodological Advances\\nOpportunities. As the development of text analysis tools\\nadvances, we expect to see new and improved use of these\\ntools in marketing, which can enable scholars to answer ques-\\ntions we could not previously address or have addressed only in\\na limited manner. Here are a few specific method-driven direc-\\ntions that seem promising.\\nFirst, the vast majority of the approaches used for text anal-\\nysis in marketing (and elsewhere) rely on bag-of-words\\napproaches, and thus, the ability to capture true linguistic rela-\\ntionships among words beyond their cooccurrence was limited.\\nHowever, in marketing we are often interested in capturing the\\nrelationship among entities. For example, what problems or\\nbenefits did the customer mention about a particular feature\\nof a particular product? Such approaches require capturing a\\ndeeper textual relationship among entities than is commonly\\nused in marketing. We expect to see future development in\\nthese areas as deep learning and NLP-based approaches enable\\nresearchers to better capture semantic relationships.\\nSecond, in marketing we are often interested in the latent\\nintention or latent states of writers when creating text, such as\\ntheir emotions, personality, and motivations. Most of the\\nresearch in this area has relied on a limited set of dictionaries\\n(primarily the LIWC dictionary) developed and validated to\\ncapture such constructs. However, these dictionaries are often\\nlimited in capturing nuanced latent states or latent states that\\nmay manifest differently across contexts. Similar to advances\\nmade in areas such as image recognition, with the availability\\nof a large number of human-coded training data (often in the\\nmillions) combined with deep learning tools, we hope to see\\nsimilar approaches being taken in marketing to capture more\\ncomplex behavioral states from text. This would require an\\neffort to human-code a large and diverse set of textual corpora\\nfor a wide range of behavioral states. Transfer learning meth-\\nods commonly used in deep learning tools such as conventional\\nneural nets can then be used to apply the learning from the\\nmore general training data to any specific application.\\nThird, there is also the possibility of using text analysis to\\npersonalize customer–firm interactions. Using machine learn-\\ning, text analysis can also help personalize the customer inter-\\naction by detecting consumer traits (e.g., personality) and states\\n(e.g., urgency, irritation) and perhaps eventually predicting\\ntraits associated with value to the firm (e.g., customer lifetime\\nvalue). After analysis, firms can then tailor customer commu-\\nnication to match linguistic style and perhaps funnel consumers\\nto the appropriate firm representative. The stakes of making\\nsuch predictions may be high, mistakes costly, and there are\\nclearly contexts in which using artificial intelligence impedes\\nconstructing meaningful custom er–firm relationships (e.g.,\\nhealth care; Longoni, Bonezzi, and Morewedge 2019).\\nFourth, while our discussion has focused on textual con-\\ntent, text is just one example of unstructured data, with audio,\\nvideo, and image being others. Social media posts often marry\\ntext with images or videos. Print advertising usually overlays\\ntext on a carefully constructed visual. Although television\\nadvertising may not include text on the screen, it may have\\nan audio track that contains text that progresses simultane-\\no u s l yw i t ht h ev i d e o .\\nUntil recently, text data has received the most attention,\\nmainly due to the presence of tools to extract meaningful fea-\\ntures. That said, tools such as Praat (Boersma 2001) allow\\nresearchers to extract information from audio (e.g., Van Zant\\nand Berger 2019). One of the advantages of audio data over text\\ndata is that it provides richness in the form of tone and voice\\nmarkers that can add to the actual words expressed (e.g., Xiao,\\nKim, and Ding 2013). This enables researchers to study not just\\nwhat was said, but how it was said, examining how pitch, tone,\\nand other vocal or paralinguistic features shape behavior.\\nSimilarly, recent research has developed approaches to ana-\\nlyze images (e.g., Liu, Xuan et al. 2018), either characterizing\\nthe content of the image or identifying features within an\\nimage. Research into the impact of the combination of text and\\nimages is sparse (e.g., Hartmann et al. 2019). For example,\\nimages can be described in terms of their colors. In the context\\nof print advertising, textual content may be less persuasive\\nwhen used in conjunction with images of a particular color\\npalette, whereas other color palettes may enhance the persua-\\nsiveness of text. Used in conjunction with simple images, the\\nimportance of text may be quite pronounced. But, when text is\\npaired with complex imagery, viewers may attend primarily to\\nthe image, diminishing the impact of the text. If this is the case,\\nlegal disclosures that are part of an advertisement’s fine print\\nmay not attract the audience’s attention.\\nAnalogous questions arise as to the role that text plays when\\nincorporated into videos. Research has proposed approaches to\\ncharacterize video content (e.g., Liu et al. 2018). In addition to\\ncomprising the script of the video, text may also appear\\nvisually. In addition to the audio context in which text appears,\\nits impact may depend on the visuals that appear simultane-\\nously. It may also be the case that its position within a video,\\nrelative to the start of the video, may moderate its\\nBerger et al. 19 effectiveness. For example, emotional text content that is spo-\\nken later in a video may be less persuasive for several reasons\\n(e.g., the audience may have ceased paying attention by the\\ntime the text is spoken). Alternatively, the visuals with which\\nthe audio is paired may be more compelling to viewers, or the\\nprevious content of the video may have depleted a viewer’s\\nattentional resources. As our discussion of both images and\\nvideos suggests, text is but one component of marketing com-\\nmunications. Future research must investigate its interplay with\\nother characteristics, including not only the content in which it\\nappears but also when it appears (e.g., Kanuri, Chen, and Srid-\\nhar 2018), and in what media.\\nChallenges. While there are a range of opportunities, textual data\\nalso brings with it various challenges. First is the interpretation\\nchallenge. In some ways, text analysis seems to provide more\\nobjective ways of measuring behavioral processes. Rather than\\nasking people how much they focused on themselves versus\\nothers when sharing word of mouth, for example, one can count\\nthe number of first-person (e.g., “I”) and second-person (e.g.,\\n“you”; Barasch and Berger 2014) pronouns, providing what\\nseems more like ground truth. But while part of this process\\nis certainly more objective (e.g., the number of different types\\nof pronouns), the link between such measures and underlying\\nprocesses (i.e., what it says about the word-of-mouth transmit-\\nter) still requires some degree of interpretation. Other latent\\nmodes of behavior are even more difficult to count. While\\nsome words (e.g., “love”) are generally positive, for example,\\nhow positive they are may depend heavily on idiosyncratic\\nindividual differences as well as the context.\\nMore generally, there is challenge and opportunity in under-\\nstanding the context in which textual information appears.\\nWhile early work in this space, particularly research using\\nentity extraction, asked questions such as how much emotion\\nis in a passage of text, more accurate answers to that question\\ntake must take context into account. A restaurant review may\\ncontain lots of negative words, for example, but does that mean\\nthe person hates the food, the service, or the restaurant more\\ngenerally? Songs that contain more second person-pronouns\\n(e.g., “you”) may be more successful (Packard and Berger\\n2019b), but to understand why, it helps to know whether the\\nlyrics use “you” as the subject or object of the sentence. Con-\\ntext provides meaning, and the more one understands not just\\nwhich words are being used but also how they are being used,\\nthe easier it will be to extract insight. Dictionary-based tools\\nare particularly susceptible to variation in the context in which\\nthe text appears, as dictionaries are often created in a context-\\nfree environment to match multiple contexts. Whenever possi-\\nble, it is advised to use a dictionary that was created for the\\nspecific context of study (e.g., the financial sentiment tool\\ndeveloped by Loughran and McDonald [2016]).\\nAs mentioned previously, there are also numerous metho-\\ndological challenges. Particularly when exploring the “why,”\\nhundreds of features can be extracted, making it important to\\nthink about multiple hypothesis testing (and use of Bonferroni\\nand other corrections). Only the text used by the text creator is\\navailable, so in some sense there is self-selection. Both the\\nindividuals who decide to contribute and the topics people\\ndecide to raise in their writing may suffer from self-selection.\\nParticularly when text is used to measure (complex) behavioral\\nconstructs, validity of the constructs needs to be considered. In\\naddition, for most researchers, analyzing textual information\\nrequires retooling and learning a whole new set of skills.\\nData privacy challenges represent a significant concern.\\nResearch often uses online product reviews and sales ranking\\ndata scraped from websites (e.g., Wang, Mai, and Chiang 2013)\\nor consumers’ social media activity scraped from the platform\\n(e.g., Godes and Mayzlin 2004; Tirunillai and Tellis 2012).\\nAlthough such approaches are common, legal questions have\\nstarted to arise. LinkedIn was unsuccessful in its attempt to\\nblock a startup company from scraping data that was posted\\non users’ public profiles (Rodriguez 2017). While scraping\\npublic data may be permissible under the law, it may conflict\\nwith the terms of service of those platforms that have data of\\ninterest to researchers. For example, Facebook deleted\\naccounts of companies that violated its data-scraping policies\\n(Nicas 2018).4 Such decisions raise important questions about\\nthe extent to which digital platforms can control access to\\ncontent that users have chosen to make publicly available.\\nAs interest in extracting insights from digitized text and\\nother forms of digitized content (e.g., images, videos) grows,\\nresearchers should ensure that they have secured the appropri-\\nate permissions to conduct their work. Failure to do so may\\nresult in it becoming more difficult to conduct such projects.\\nOne potential solution is the creation of an academic data set,\\nsuch as that made available by Yelp (https://www.yelp.com/\\ndataset), which may contain outdated or scrubbed data to\\nensure that it does not pose any risk to the company’s opera-\\ntions or user privacy.\\nThe collection and analysis of digitized text, as well as other\\nuser-created content, also raises questions around users’ expecta-\\ntions for privacy. In the wake of the European Union’s General\\nData Protection Regulation and revelations about Cambridge\\nAnalytica’s ability to collect user data from Facebook, research-\\ners must be mindful of the potential abuses of their work. We\\nshould also consider the extent to which we are overstepping the\\nintended use of user-generated content. For example, while a user\\nmay understand that actions taken on Facebook may result in their\\nbeing targeted with specific advertisements for brands with which\\nthey have interacted, they may not anticipate the totality of their\\nFacebook and Instagram activity being used to construct psycho-\\ngraphic profiles that may be used by other brands. Understanding\\nconsumers’ privacy preferences with regard to their online beha-\\nviors and the text they make available could provide important\\nguidance for practitioners and researchers alike. Another rich area\\nfor future research is the advancement of the precision with which\\nmarketing can be implemented while minimizing intrusions of\\nprivacy (e.g., Provost et al. 2009).\\n4 Facebook’s terms of service with regard to automated data collection can be\\nfound at https://www.facebook.com/apps/site_scraping_tos_terms.php.\\n20 Journal of Marketing 84(1) Concluding Thoughts\\nCommunication is an important facet of marketing that encom-\\npasses communication between organizations and their partners,\\nbetween businesses and their consumers, and among consumers.\\nTextual data holds details of these communications, and through\\nautomated textual analysis, researchers are poised to convert this\\nraw material into valuable insights. Many of the recent advances\\nin the use of textual data were developed in fields outside of\\nmarketing. As we look toward the future and the role of market-\\ners, these recent advancements should serve as exemplars. Mar-\\nketers are well positioned at the interface between consumers,\\nfirms, and organizations to leverage and advance tools to extract\\ntextual information to address some of the key issues faced by\\nbusiness and society today, such as the proliferation of misin-\\nformation, the pervasiveness of technology in our lives, and the\\nrole of marketing in society. Marketing offers an invaluable\\nperspective that is vital to this conversation, but it will only be\\nby taking a broader perspective, breaking theoretical and meth-\\nodological silos, and engaging with other disciplines that our\\nresearch can reach its largest possible audience to affect the\\npublic discourse. We hope this framework encourages a reflec-\\ntion on the boundaries that have come to define marketing and\\nopens avenues for future groundbreaking insights.\\nEditors\\nChristine Moorman and Harald van Heerde\\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\\nFunding\\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\\nship, and/or publication of this article.\\nReferences\\nAkpinar, Ezgi, and Jonah Berger (2015), “Drivers of Cultural Success:\\nT h eC a s eo fS e n s o r yM e t a p h o r s , ”Journal of Personality and\\nSocial Psychology, 109 (1), 20–34.\\nAlessa, Ali, and Miad Faezipour (2018), “A Review of Influenza\\nDetection and Prediction Through Social Networking Sites,”The-\\noretical Biology and Medical Modelling, 15 (1), 1–27.\\nAnderson, Eric T., and Duncan I.

Jonah, thanks for being here. Well, thanks for having me. Now, what was the inspiration for focusing on social influence as the topic of your next book? You know, there's a funny story that I mentioned briefly in the book, but a number of years ago my dad was buying a new car. He lives in DC. He's a lawyer there and he bought a BMW. And then he was complaining that all DC lawyers buy BMWs. I said, well, dad, you bought BMWs. He said, oh, but mine's a blue one. Everyone else drives a gray one. And I think what's really funny about that is social influence happens in the world. Right? We see everybody else doing the same thing. Oh, look at all those DC lawyers. They all drive the same car. But when it comes to our own behavior, sometimes we feel like our own behavior is somehow privileged or different. I'm a rugged individualist. I'm independent. No one else has any effect on what I do. And actually we're kind of wrong. And so what I thought would be interesting to talk about in this book is all the science about how other shape our behavior, often without us knowing it, and what we can do about it and how we can use it to live happier and healthier lives. And now your previous book contagious focused on why things go viral. And I wondered, do you feel like there's an interplay between social influence and virality? I could kind of see how there would be. Oh, certainly. I mean, they're both related to how people shape other people's behavior or decisions. The first book contagious was more about how do we influence others, right? If I'm a business owner or I have an idea I want to spread within my organization, contagious was about, well, we know where it matters. How do I get people to talk about and share my stuff? Invisible influence is a little bit actually almost the converse or the opposite. It's, well, how are other people affecting my behavior? Sure, we can use that to influence others, but we can also use it to make ourselves better off, to help us make better decisions or be healthier when we're having trouble doing that. Now I thought it was interesting in the book that I mean, the book's really not about how to go above the influence because you kind of make the point that resistance is a bit futile when it comes to social influences that whether we know it or not, it's happening. Yeah. And that's I think the most interesting part. We see it all the time. If you ask people to social influence this, of course, my neighbor bought this thing because someone else bought it. My wife did this thing because someone else was doing it, but we don't necessarily see it in ourselves. And I think that idea of resistance as futile is important. I think what we have to be careful of is influence is always a bad thing. Imagine if we couldn't use others as a source of information. If every time we wanted to figure out where to go out to dinner or what movie to watch, we had to sample it ourselves. Exhausting. We'd have to read all the information and look at all the options and sample a little bit here and there. Others are really helpful, cue. Others often help us make better decisions, but not always. And so as invisible influence talks about, you know, when others help us make better decisions, when do they make worse decisions, when do others motivate us, when do they demotivate us, and how can we use this to be better off? Another brings me to my next question. So if we know that social influence is going to play a role, and I think even before I let the book, you know, it plays a little bit, but your book really shows how much of a role it really does play. If we know this, how can we harness that and use it to help us make better decisions? Yeah, so great example. So one thing I talk a little about is motivation. Others often affect whether we give up, whether we try harder. How can we use that to be better off? One thing I felt in my own life, you know, you want to exercise, you want to be healthier. How can you use others to help you do that? Some simple tricks like working out with other people, really having someone else to compare yourself to. There's lots of research on something called social facilitation. Mearily biking with someone else, for example, makes you bike faster. Running with someone else makes you run faster. Swimming with someone else makes you swim faster. Others can help us do things that we might not do otherwise. And so we can set up situations where we actually encourage ourselves to be healthier, encourage ourselves to make better choices by shaping our environment through others. Now, the book really plays into sort of this dichotomy of it either motivates us or demotivates us. Social influence makes us want to do something similar or it makes us want to do something different. What is, I mean, one of the factors that go into determining like how whether social influence, for example, want us, want to make us want to buy the same cars or neighbor versus buy a different one or make us want to work harder versus give up. Yeah. So I have to give you a long answer for all of it. But I think some simple things are, you know, first, others often provide information. So when we're uncertain about what to do, we often look to others and that leads us often to the same thing. Yet at the same time, we want to see ourselves as different, particularly in American culture, we like to see ourselves as special snowflakes. No one else is exactly like my dad buying, you know, the blue BMW rather than the gray one. And so maybe we pick the same car because we know it's a good car because others have bought it, but we pick a different color because colors allow us to feel different. So we're similar and different at the same time. We're optimally distinct or in terms of motivation, for example, you know, others can motivate us, except when they're too much better than we are. And if we compare ourselves to someone who's much better, much faster than we are, sometimes it causes us to give up. You know, we say, well, there's no way I'm going to reach that standard or that score, that level of performance. And so there's so much better than I am that I'm not going to try anymore. And so it's really about understanding the subtle differences of social comparisons and understanding the situations people are in that helps us figure out which way it goes. Now you have a couple really interesting sort of examples like this in this book. So one of my favorite ones I have to say was about why does it make it, why does social influence make it harder for us to parallel park, but easier to tire shoes and the reason is I hate it when people watch me parallel park. I'm horrible at it. If someone's watching, I'm a master if no one is. Yeah. So actually, can I tell you a story and a sort of to get there? So there's this wonderful old study on motivation. And so this research was interesting, just the question you were interested in. He looked at a bunch of research and said, well, sometimes others seem to be motivating least to work harder, do better. Sometimes they lead us to get demotivated, do worse. Why is that? You know, what are situations that lead to one versus the other? And so we wanted to figure out a way to test that. So we designed this amazing experiment with running, actually, looking at how running was affected by other other individuals watching run. But he didn't do it with people. He did it with cockroaches. So we built this like cockroach stadium where these little cockroaches would run cockroach races, you know, run from one stadium side to the other. But then he could manipulate whether other cockroaches watching them. By the way, this is sort of ridiculous thing about cockroaches watching other cockroaches. But he was interested in how does the mere presence of others affect what we do. And he had them run one of two mazes, one that was either straight ahead. You're just really easy or one we had to run straight and then make a left turn really difficult. More sort of requirement out, do I go right? Do I go left? What do I do? And what he found is when the task was easy, when it was well learned running straight, something cockroaches know how to do well, having others around helped them do better. They ran faster with others than they did by themselves. But when it was a difficult task, when they had to sort of figure out, do I go left or do I go right, then it was more complicated. And then the mere presence of others actually made them do worse. And so that's exactly as you mentioned, sort of parallel parking versus other aspects. If we know how to do things well, if they're easy things we've already done a bunch, then having other round makes us do them better. If you're a great shooting pool, for example, shooting pool with someone else, actually make you better at shooting pool than by yourself. But if you're not so good at shooting pool, if it's something that you're not used to doing, if it's difficult for you, then having others around can make you do worse. And so parallel parking, for example, most of us, maybe some of us are good at parallel parking, but most of us tend to be a little bit nervous to begin with. We're not excellent parallel parkers. Clearly having someone else in the car can make it more difficult for us. Makes us more nervous, more anxious. And while that anxiety can help us do better when it's easy for us to do those tasks, they can lead us to do worse when it's a difficult or complicated task. And now you also get back to car buying a little bit. You talk a little bit about in the book how, in fact, people who are more well off, they might be more likely to try to buy a different car than their neighbors, whereas those of us that are maybe more in the middle class, lower class, that we actually, might actually, that social influence might actually cause us to buy the same car. So we tend to think in American culture that it's the uniqueness is the right answer. People who unique and different are good and people who are conformists are bad. Like being a conformist is a negative thing. But it's not a really a right or a wrong answer. It's more of a cultural value. Think about East Asian cultural context, for example, where fitting in being a good member of the group is the right answer. You know, it's not the squeaky real gets the grease. It's the nail that stands out gets hammered down. Even true in American cultural context, in working class context, people like being part of a group, people like being connected to others that are like them. Why would it be bad if you had the same car as your neighbor? It shows that you like the same things that you have a lot in common, whereas in other parts of American culture, we say, oh, you know, standing out is the right thing to do. Why would I want the same thing as everyone else? I want to show that I'm different. And so it's interesting is uniqueness isn't right answer or wrong answer. It's just a way of behaving based on our social environment. Now, I was curious about, now, as the internet has become part of our daily lives all the time, as social media has become more of our daily lives, I feel like it's easier and easier to know what your friends are doing. It's easier for companies to know what even what your friends are doing. How does that play into social influence and maybe the degree to which social influence is playing a role in our decisions? Yeah. What's so interesting about the internet, it's made information spread faster. It's easier as you nicely said to see what others are doing. But that has two kind of differing effects. First, it makes it easier to copy others. So we hear a new band, our friends are listening, we're going to listen to it, makes things catch on much faster than they would have before. Which seems great. If you're that band, it seems fantastic. I've caught on. But it also makes it easier for people to switch to something else or avoid something because too many people are doing it. As I talk about in the book, we don't just want to be similar, we also want to be different. And so sometimes when too many people like a particular band, we say, well, I don't like it anymore. I like their old stuff before they became mainstream. And so what it's really done is it's led to faster cycles of fads and fashion things catch on more quickly, but they also die out just as quickly. And so one thing I talk a lot about for companies and organizations is, well, how do we manage this? As a brand, for example, I want to catch the upswing. I want my product to be everyone to be buying it. But how do we avoid the downswing when people say, well, it's too popular. I don't want it anymore. If those people are doing it, maybe I don't want it. And so how can we capture the good aspects of that and avoid the bad? Now, is it really though? I mean, it seems like it would be so fleeting for companies to catch the upswing. It seems by the time you know there isn't upswing, it's already on the downswing. Yeah, a little bit. I mean, what's also allowed and possible now is there's so much rich behavioral data that we can get more of a sense of who's buying something, what else they've bought and what they're like. And so, Amazon, for example, has a good sense of what type of books we like and can say, well, these type of people used to are, I think, this now a different type of folks are buying it. And so I agree with you. It's not perfect data, but it's certainly better than it's been before. Now, did you, while you were writing this book or researching this book, did you catch yourself at all in terms of like, were you surprised to realize how social influence played into your decisions? Yeah, I am the worst person to shop with or make decisions with. I have a huge problem making decisions. In part of it, because I'm always thinking, well, what are other people doing, right? And I'm saying, well, if they're doing, it's the reason I'm doing it because other people are doing it, or do I really like it myself? And what's interesting is there's no answer to that question. Others often affect us without are realizing it, but by being aware of it, sometimes hopefully we can make better decisions than we would have otherwise. Now, as you were saying, we have this vision, particularly, I think, in an American culture of the rugged individualist. I mean, we place a very high value on non-conformists. I mean, non-conformists are the best. They're pathbreakers. They're above the influence. But what does this book say about, like, I mean, does a non-conformist really exist? And if it does, I mean, this book sort of speaks to like how hard it must be to really be a non-conformist. Yeah. So there's a great cartoon, South Park. You probably aware of it, that has a show where one of the characters says to another, oh, you can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. And what I think is so true about that is even non-conformists are conforming. It's very rare that you find someone that's not influenced by anyone else, even avoiding what others are doing. You're still being influenced. You're just saying, well, I don't want to be like them. Goffs, for example, you look at kids that dress in all black, well, they're all actually pretty similar to one another. And we like to see ourselves as different. We like to think, oh, you know, the unique person, the non-conformist, they went out, they lead companies. Really, those people conform just as much as everybody else. It's just they don't seem like they're conforming because they may not be doing what the mainstream is doing, but they tend to still do what other people like them do. Great. Jonah, thanks so much for being here. Oh, thanks for traveling.\", \" In his new book, Invisible Influence, the Hidden Forces that Shape Behavior, Wharton Marketing Professor Jonah Berger, takes us inside the conscious and unconscious ways that social influences shape our decisions. Jonah, thanks for being here. Well, thanks for having me. Now, what was the inspiration for focusing on social influence as the topic of your next book? You know, there's a funny story that I mentioned briefly in the book, but a number of years ago my dad was buying a new car. He lives in DC. He's a lawyer there and he bought a BMW. And then he was complaining that all DC lawyers buy BMWs. I said, well, dad, you bought BMWs. He said, oh, but mine's a blue one. Everyone else drives a gray one. And I think what's really funny about that is social influence happens in the world. Right? We see everybody else doing the same thing. Oh, look at all those DC lawyers. They all drive the same car. But when it comes to our own behavior, sometimes we feel like our own behavior is somehow privileged or different. I'm a rugged individualist. I'm independent. No one else has any effect on what I do. And actually we're kind of wrong. And so what I thought would be interesting to talk about in this book is all the science about how other shape our behavior, often without us knowing it, and what we can do about it and how we can use it to live happier and healthier lives. And now your previous book contagious focused on why things go viral. And I wondered, do you feel like there's an interplay between social influence and virality? I could kind of see how there would be. Oh, certainly. I mean, they're both related to how people shape other people's behavior or decisions. The first book contagious was more about how do we influence others, right? If I'm a business owner or I have an idea I want to spread within my organization, contagious was about, well, we know where it matters. How do I get people to talk about and share my stuff? Invisible influence is a little bit actually almost the converse or the opposite. It's, well, how are other people affecting my behavior? Sure, we can use that to influence others, but we can also use it to make ourselves better off, to help us make better decisions or be healthier when we're having trouble doing that. Now I thought it was interesting in the book that I mean, the book's really not about how to go above the influence because you kind of make the point that resistance is a bit futile when it comes to social influences that whether we know it or not, it's happening. Yeah. And that's I think the most interesting part. We see it all the time. If you ask people to social influence this, of course, my neighbor bought this thing because someone else bought it. My wife did this thing because someone else was doing it, but we don't necessarily see it in ourselves. And I think that idea of resistance as futile is important. I think what we have to be careful of is influence is always a bad thing. Imagine if we couldn't use others as a source of information. If every time we wanted to figure out where to go out to dinner or what movie to watch, we had to sample it ourselves. Exhausting. We'd have to read all the information and look at all the options and sample a little bit here and there. Others are really helpful, cue. Others often help us make better decisions, but not always. And so as invisible influence talks about, you know, when others help us make better decisions, when do they make worse decisions, when do others motivate us, when do they demotivate us, and how can we use this to be better off? Another brings me to my next question. So if we know that social influence is going to play a role, and I think even before I let the book, you know, it plays a little bit, but your book really shows how much of a role it really does play. If we know this, how can we harness that and use it to help us make better decisions? Yeah, so great example. So one thing I talk a little about is motivation. Others often affect whether we give up, whether we try harder. How can we use that to be better off? One thing I felt in my own life, you know, you want to exercise, you want to be healthier. How can you use others to help you do that? Some simple tricks like working out with other people, really having someone else to compare yourself to. There's lots of research on something called social facilitation. Mearily biking with someone else, for example, makes you bike faster. Running with someone else makes you run faster. Swimming with someone else makes you swim faster. Others can help us do things that we might not do otherwise. And so we can set up situations where we actually encourage ourselves to be healthier, encourage ourselves to make better choices by shaping our environment through others. Now, the book really plays into sort of this dichotomy of it either motivates us or demotivates us. Social influence makes us want to do something similar or it makes us want to do something different. What is, I mean, one of the factors that go into determining like how whether social influence, for example, want us, want to make us want to buy the same cars or neighbor versus buy a different one or make us want to work harder versus give up. Yeah. So I have to give you a long answer for all of it. But I think some simple things are, you know, first, others often provide information. So when we're uncertain about what to do, we often look to others and that leads us often to the same thing. Yet at the same time, we want to see ourselves as different, particularly in American culture, we like to see ourselves as special snowflakes. No one else is exactly like my dad buying, you know, the blue BMW rather than the gray one. And so maybe we pick the same car because we know it's a good car because others have bought it, but we pick a different color because colors allow us to feel different. So we're similar and different at the same time. We're optimally distinct or in terms of motivation, for example, you know, others can motivate us, except when they're too much better than we are. And if we compare ourselves to someone who's much better, much faster than we are, sometimes it causes us to give up. You know, we say, well, there's no way I'm going to reach that standard or that score, that level of performance. And so there's so much better than I am that I'm not going to try anymore. And so it's really about understanding the subtle differences of social comparisons and understanding the situations people are in that helps us figure out which way it goes. Now you have a couple really interesting sort of examples like this in this book. So one of my favorite ones I have to say was about why does it make it, why does social influence make it harder for us to parallel park, but easier to tire shoes and the reason is I hate it when people watch me parallel park. I'm horrible at it. If someone's watching, I'm a master if no one is. Yeah. So actually, can I tell you a story and a sort of to get there? So there's this wonderful old study on motivation. And so this research was interesting, just the question you were interested in. He looked at a bunch of research and said, well, sometimes others seem to be motivating least to work harder, do better. Sometimes they lead us to get demotivated, do worse. Why is that? You know, what are situations that lead to one versus the other? And so we wanted to figure out a way to test that. So we designed this amazing experiment with running, actually, looking at how running was affected by other other individuals watching run. But he didn't do it with people. He did it with cockroaches. So we built this like cockroach stadium where these little cockroaches would run cockroach races, you know, run from one stadium side to the other. But then he could manipulate whether other cockroaches watching them. By the way, this is sort of ridiculous thing about cockroaches watching other cockroaches. But he was interested in how does the mere presence of others affect what we do. And he had them run one of two mazes, one that was either straight ahead. You're just really easy or one we had to run straight and then make a left turn really difficult. More sort of requirement out, do I go right? Do I go left? What do I do? And what he found is when the task was easy, when it was well learned running straight, something cockroaches know how to do well, having others around helped them do better. They ran faster with others than they did by themselves. But when it was a difficult task, when they had to sort of figure out, do I go left or do I go right, then it was more complicated. And then the mere presence of others actually made them do worse. And so that's exactly as you mentioned, sort of parallel parking versus other aspects. If we know how to do things well, if they're easy things we've already done a bunch, then having other round makes us do them better. If you're a great shooting pool, for example, shooting pool with someone else, actually make you better at shooting pool than by yourself. But if you're not so good at shooting pool, if it's something that you're not used to doing, if it's difficult for you, then having others around can make you do worse. And so parallel parking, for example, most of us, maybe some of us are good at parallel parking, but most of us tend to be a little bit nervous to begin with. We're not excellent parallel parkers. Clearly having someone else in the car can make it more difficult for us. Makes us more nervous, more anxious. And while that anxiety can help us do better when it's easy for us to do those tasks, they can lead us to do worse when it's a difficult or complicated task. And now you also get back to car buying a little bit. You talk a little bit about in the book how, in fact, people who are more well off, they might be more likely to try to buy a different car than their neighbors, whereas those of us that are maybe more in the middle class, lower class, that we actually, might actually, that social influence might actually cause us to buy the same car. So we tend to think in American culture that it's the uniqueness is the right answer. People who unique and different are good and people who are conformists are bad. Like being a conformist is a negative thing. But it's not a really a right or a wrong answer. It's more of a cultural value. Think about East Asian cultural context, for example, where fitting in being a good member of the group is the right answer. You know, it's not the squeaky real gets the grease. It's the nail that stands out gets hammered down. Even true in American cultural context, in working class context, people like being part of a group, people like being connected to others that are like them. Why would it be bad if you had the same car as your neighbor? It shows that you like the same things that you have a lot in common, whereas in other parts of American culture, we say, oh, you know, standing out is the right thing to do. Why would I want the same thing as everyone else? I want to show that I'm different. And so it's interesting is uniqueness isn't right answer or wrong answer. It's just a way of behaving based on our social environment. Now, I was curious about, now, as the internet has become part of our daily lives all the time, as social media has become more of our daily lives, I feel like it's easier and easier to know what your friends are doing. It's easier for companies to know what even what your friends are doing. How does that play into social influence and maybe the degree to which social influence is playing a role in our decisions? Yeah. What's so interesting about the internet, it's made information spread faster. It's easier as you nicely said to see what others are doing. But that has two kind of differing effects. First, it makes it easier to copy others. So we hear a new band, our friends are listening, we're going to listen to it, makes things catch on much faster than they would have before. Which seems great. If you're that band, it seems fantastic. I've caught on. But it also makes it easier for people to switch to something else or avoid something because too many people are doing it. As I talk about in the book, we don't just want to be similar, we also want to be different. And so sometimes when too many people like a particular band, we say, well, I don't like it anymore. I like their old stuff before they became mainstream. And so what it's really done is it's led to faster cycles of fads and fashion things catch on more quickly, but they also die out just as quickly. And so one thing I talk a lot about for companies and organizations is, well, how do we manage this? As a brand, for example, I want to catch the upswing. I want my product to be everyone to be buying it. But how do we avoid the downswing when people say, well, it's too popular. I don't want it anymore. If those people are doing it, maybe I don't want it. And so how can we capture the good aspects of that and avoid the bad? Now, is it really though? I mean, it seems like it would be so fleeting for companies to catch the upswing. It seems by the time you know there isn't upswing, it's already on the downswing. Yeah, a little bit. I mean, what's also allowed and possible now is there's so much rich behavioral data that we can get more of a sense of who's buying something, what else they've bought and what they're like. And so, Amazon, for example, has a good sense of what type of books we like and can say, well, these type of people used to are, I think, this now a different type of folks are buying it. And so I agree with you. It's not perfect data, but it's certainly better than it's been before. Now, did you, while you were writing this book or researching this book, did you catch yourself at all in terms of like, were you surprised to realize how social influence played into your decisions? Yeah, I am the worst person to shop with or make decisions with. I have a huge problem making decisions. In part of it, because I'm always thinking, well, what are other people doing, right? And I'm saying, well, if they're doing, it's the reason I'm doing it because other people are doing it, or do I really like it myself? And what's interesting is there's no answer to that question. Others often affect us without are realizing it, but by being aware of it, sometimes hopefully we can make better decisions than we would have otherwise. Now, as you were saying, we have this vision, particularly, I think, in an American culture of the rugged individualist. I mean, we place a very high value on non-conformists. I mean, non-conformists are the best. They're pathbreakers. They're above the influence. But what does this book say about, like, I mean, does a non-conformist really exist? And if it does, I mean, this book sort of speaks to like how hard it must be to really be a non-conformist. Yeah. So there's a great cartoon, South Park. You probably aware of it, that has a show where one of the characters says to another, oh, you can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. And what I think is so true about that is even non-conformists are conforming. It's very rare that you find someone that's not influenced by anyone else, even avoiding what others are doing. You're still being influenced. You're just saying, well, I don't want to be like them.
