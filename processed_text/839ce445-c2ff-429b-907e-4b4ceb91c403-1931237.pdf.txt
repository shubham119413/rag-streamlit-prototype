conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used for any 
purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research.” If a user makes a 
request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of 
“fair use,” that user may be liable for copyright infringement.  
 
This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its
