 Hello, I want to write my gratitude letter to Harsh Mithil. He was the CEO of the previous company I was in and he was my direct manager. So dear Harsh, I've been meaning to write this for a while but as I reflect on my time at UB, I just want to say thank you. Being alongside you as G for staff was not just a job, it was an incredibly formative experience that shaped the way I think, lead and solve problems. From the very beginning, you trusted me with high impact projects whether it was working with the recruiting projects for senior leadership or negotiating with billion dollar partners like Infosys, I learned quite a bit, I learned so much from watching you navigate complex problems, more often than not with the balance of clarity, technical insight and commitment to doing the right thing. Your ability to break down problems, ask the right questions and push for better solutions is something I continue to carry with me. Beyond the work itself, I'm grateful for the way you lead, you created an environment where I could take ownership, make mistakes and grow. You never micromanaged but you always made time for guidance when it mattered the most. That mix of autonomy and support gave me the confidence to take on challenges I never thought I'd be ready for. I truly appreciate everything you taught me and the impact you've had on my journey. I hope we cross paths again, genuinely. But until then, I just wanted to know how much your mentorship meant to me.
